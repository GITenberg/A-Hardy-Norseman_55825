<p class='c007'>“You say your things are all ready, Cecil? Then I’ll just
go below and do up my Gladstone, and put it in your cabin.
We shall be at Bergen before long, they say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker was a young Englishman of three-or-four-and-twenty,
and the sister addressed by him was still in the first
flush of girlhood, having but a few days before celebrated her
nineteenth birthday.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me see to your bag, Roy,” she exclaimed. “It is a
shame that you should miss this lovely bit of the fjord, and I
shall do it in half the time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The conceit of women!” he exclaimed, with a smile in
which brotherly love and the spirit of teasing were about
equally blended. “No, no, Cis, I’m not going to let you
spoil me. I shall be up again in ten minutes. Have you not
made any friends here? Is there no one on deck you can
talk to?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t want to talk,” said Cecil. “Truth to tell, I am
longing to get away from all these English people. Very unsociable
of me, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy Boniface turned away with a smile, understanding her
feeling well enough, and Cecil, with her back to the chattering
tourist throng, let her eyes roam over the shining waters of the
fjord to the craggy mountains on the further shore, whose ever-varying
forms had been delighting her since the early morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>She herself made a fair picture, though her beauty was not
of the order which quickly draws attention. There was nothing
very striking in her regular features, fair complexion, and
light-brown hair; to a casual observer she would have seemed
merely an average English girl, gentle, well-mannered, and nice-looking.
It was only to those who took pains to study her that
her true nature was revealed; only at times that her quiet gray
eyes would flash into sudden beauty with the pleasure of meeting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>with some rare and unexpected sympathy; only in some
special need that the force of her naturally retiring nature
made itself felt as a great influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil had passed a year of emancipated girlhood, she had for
a whole year been her own mistress, had had time and money
at her disposal and no special duties to take the place of her
school-work. It was the time she had been looking forward
to all her life, the blissful time of grown-up freedom, and
now that it had come it had proved a disappointing illusion.
Whether the fault was in herself or in her circumstances she
did not know; but like so many girls of her age she was looking
out on life with puzzled eyes, hardly knowing what it was
that had gone amiss, yet conscious of a great want, of a great
unrest, of a vague dissatisfaction which would not be reasoned
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cecil is looking poorly,” had been the home verdict; and
the mother, not fully understanding the cause, but with a true
instinct as to the remedy, had suggested that the brother and
sister should spend a month abroad, grieving to lose Cecil from
the usual family visit to the seaside, but perceiving with a
mother’s wisdom and unselfishness that it was time, as she
expressed it, for her young one to try its wings.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the big steamer plied its way up the fjord bearing Cecil
Boniface and her small troubles and perplexities to healthy old
Norway, to gain there fresh physical strength, and fresh insights
into that puzzling thing called life; to make friendships, spite
of her avowed unsociableness, to learn something more of the
beauty of beauty, the joy of joy, and the pain of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was no student of human nature; at present with girlish
impatience she turned away from the tourists, frankly avowing
her conviction that they were a bore. She was willing to
let her fancy roam to the fortunes of some imaginary Rolf and
Erica living, perhaps, in some one or other of the solitary red-roofed
cottages to be seen now and then on the mountain-side;
but the average English life displayed on the deck did not in
the least awaken her sympathies, she merely classified the passengers
into rough groups and dismissed them from her mind.
There was the photographic group, fraternizing over the cameras
set up all in a little encampment at the forecastle end.
There was the clerical group, which had for its center no fewer
than five gaitered bishops. There was the sporting group, distinguished
by light-brown checked suits, and comfortable traveling-caps.
There was the usual sprinkling of pale, weary,
overworked men and women come for a much-needed rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>And there was the flirting group—a notably small one, however,
for Norwegian traveling is rough work and is ill-suited
to this genus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look, here, Blanche,” exclaimed a gray-bearded Englishman,
approaching a pretty little brunette who had a most sweet
and winsome expression, and who was standing so near to the
camp-stool on which Cecil had ensconced herself that the conversation
was quite audible to her. “Just see if you can’t
make out this writing; your eyes are better than mine. It is
from Herr Falck, the Norwegian agent for our firm. I dare
say your father told you about him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, papa said he was one of the leading merchants out
here and would advise us what to see, and where to go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite so. This letter reached me just as I was leaving home,
and is to say that Herr Falck has taken rooms for us at some
hotel. I can read it all well enough except the names, but the
fellow makes such outrageous flourishes. What do you make
of this sentence, beginning with ‘My son Frithiof’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Uncle! uncle! what shocking pronunciation! You must
not put in an English ‘th.’ Did you never hear of the Frithiof
Saga? You must say it quickly like this—Freet-Yoff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A most romantic name,” said Mr. Morgan. “Now I see
why you have been so industrious over your Norwegian lessons.
You mean to carry on a desperate flirtation with
Herr Frithiof. Oh! that is quite clear—I shall be on the
lookout!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Blanche laughed, not at all resenting the remark, though she
bent her pretty face over the letter, and pretended to have
great difficulty in reading Herr Falck’s very excellent English.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you want to hear this sentence?” she said, “because if
you do I’ll read it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘My son Frithiof will do himself the honor to await your
arrival at Bergen on the landing-quay, and will drive you to
Holdt’s Hotel, where we have procured the rooms you desired.
My daughter Sigrid (See-gree) is eager to make the acquaintance
of your daughter and your niece, and if you will all dine
with us at two o’clock on Friday at my villa in Kalvedalen we
shall esteem it a great pleasure.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two-o’clock dinner!” exclaimed Florence Morgan, for the
first time joining in the general conversation. “What an unheard-of
hour!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! everything is primitive simplicity out here,” said Mr.
Morgan. “You needn’t expect London fashions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose Frithiof Falck will be a sort of young Viking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>large-boned and dignified, with a kind of good-natured fierceness
about him,” said Blanche, folding the letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” said Florence, “he’ll be a shy, stupid country
bumpkin, afraid of airing his bad English, and you will step
valiantly into the breach with your fluent Norwegian, and your
kindness will win his heart. Then presently he will come up
in his artless and primitive way with a <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Vaer saa god</span></i> (if you
please) and will take your hand. You will reply <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Mange tak</span></i>
(many thanks), and we shall all joyfully dance at your
wedding.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was general laughter, and some trifling bets were
made upon the vexed question of Frithiof Falck’s appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Mr. Morgan, “it’s all very well to laugh now,
but I hope you’ll be civil to the Falcks when we really meet.
And as to you, Cyril,” he continued, turning to his nephew, a
limp-looking young man of one-and-twenty, “get all the information
you can out of young Falck, but on no account allow
him to know that your father is seriously thinking of setting
you at the head of the proposed branch at Stavanger. When
that does come about, of course Herr Falck will lose our custom,
and no doubt it will be a blow to him; so mind you don’t
breathe a word about it, nor you either, girls. We don’t want
to spoil our holiday with business matters, and besides, one
should always consider other people’s feelings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil set her teeth and the color rose to her cheeks; she
moved away to the other side of the deck that she might not
hear any more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What hateful people! they don’t care a bit for the kindness
and hospitality of these Norwegians. They only mean just
to use them as a convenience.” Then as her brother rejoined
her she exclaimed, “Roy, who are those vulgar people over on
the other side?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With two pretty girls in blue ulsters? I think the name is
Morgan, rich city people. The old man’s not bad, but the
young one’s a born snob. What do you think I heard him
say as he was writing his name in the book and caught sight of
ours. ‘Why, Robert Boniface—that must be the music-shop
in Regent Street. Norway will soon be spoiled if all the cads
take to coming over.’ And there was I within two yards of
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Roy! he couldn’t have known or he would never have
said it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, he knew it well enough. It was meant for a
snub, richly deserved by the presuming tradesman who dared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to come to Norway for his holiday instead of eating shrimps at
Margate, as such cattle should, you know!” and Roy laughed
good-humoredly. Snubs had a way of gliding off him like
water off a duck’s back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should have hated it,” said Cecil. “What did you do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing; studied Baedeker with an imperturbable face,
and reflected sapiently with William of Wykeham that neither
birth nor calling but ‘manners makyth man.’ But look! this
must be Bergen. What a glorious view! If only you had time
to sketch it just from here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil, after one quick exclamation of delight, was quite
silent, for indeed few people can see unmoved that exquisite
view which is unfolded before them as they round the fjord
and catch the first glimpse of the most beautiful town in Norway.
Had she been alone she would have allowed the tears
of happiness to come into her eyes, but being on a crowded
steamer she fought down her emotion and watched in a sort of
dream of delight the picturesque wooden houses, the red-tiled
roofs, the quaint towers and spires, the clear still fjord, with
its forest of masts and rigging, and the mountains rising steep
and sheer, encircling Bergen like so many hoary old giants
who had vowed to protect the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, the deck resounded with those comments which
are so very irritating to most lovers of scenery; one long-haired
æsthete gave vent to a fresh adjective of admiration
about once a minute, till Roy and Cecil were forced to flee
from him and to take refuge among the sporting fraternity,
who occasionally admitted frankly that it was “a fine view,”
but who obtruded their personality far less upon their companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Roy, how we shall enjoy it all!” said Cecil, as they
drew near to the crowded landing-quay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we shall fit in, Cis,” he said, smiling. “Thank
Heaven, you don’t take your pleasure after the manner of that
fellow. If I were his traveling companion I should throttle him
in a week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Or suggest a muzzle,” said Cecil, laughing; “that would
save both his neck and your feelings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me have your key,” he said, as they approached the
wooden pier; “the custom-house people will be coming on
board, and I will try to get our things looked over quickly.
Wait here and then I shall not miss you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He hastened away and Cecil scanned with curious eyes the
faces of the little crowd gathered on the landing-quay, till her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>attention was arrested by a young Norwegian in a light-gray
suit who stood laughing and talking to an acquaintance on the
wooden wharf. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with something
unusually erect and energetic in his bearing; his features
were of the pure Greek type not unfrequently to be met
with in Norway; while his northern birth was attested by a fair
skin and light hair and mustache, as well as by a pair of honest,
well-opened blue eyes which looked out on the world with a
boyish content and happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe that is Frithiof Falck,” thought Cecil. And the
next moment her idea was confirmed, for as the connecting
gangway was raised from the quay, one of the steamer officials
greeted him by name, and the young Norwegian, replying in
very good English, stepped on board and began looking about
as if in search of some one. Involuntarily Cecil’s eyes followed
him; she had a strange feeling that in some way she knew him,
knew him far better than the people he had come to meet.
He, too, seemed affected in the same way, for he came
straight up to her, and, raising his hat and bowing, said, with
frank courtesy:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me, but am I speaking to Miss Morgan?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think the Miss Morgans are at the other side of the gangway;
I saw them a minute ago,” she said, coloring a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand pardons for my mistake,” said Frithiof Falck.
“I came to meet this English family, you understand, but I
have never seen them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is Miss Morgan,” exclaimed Cecil; “that lady in a
blue ulster; and there is her uncle just joining her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many thanks for your kind help,” said Frithiof, and with
a second bow, and a smile from his frank eyes, he passed on
and approached Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Welcome to Norway, sir,” he exclaimed, greeting the traveler
with the easy, courteous manner peculiar to Norwegians.
“I hope you have made a good voyage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Falck?” said the Englishman,
scanning him from head to foot as he shook hands, and speaking
very loud, as if the foreigner were deaf. “Very good of you
to meet us, I’m sure. My niece, Miss Blanche Morgan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof bowed, and his heart began to beat fast as a pair of
most lovely dark-gray eyes gave him such a glance as he had
never before received.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My sister is much looking forward to the pleasure of making
your acquaintance,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” exclaimed Blanche, “how beautifully you speak English!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>And how you will laugh at me when I tell you that I
have been learning Norwegian for fear there should be dead
silence between us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, there is nothing which pleases us so much as that
you should learn our tongue,” he said, smiling. “My English
is just now in its zenith, for I passed the winter with an English
clergyman at Hanover for the sake of improving it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But why not have come to England?” said Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I had before that been with a German family at
Hanover to perfect myself in German, and I liked the place
well, and this Englishman was very pleasant, so I thought if I
stayed there it would be ‘to kill two flies with one dash,’ as we
say in Norway. When I come to England that will be for a
holiday, for nothing at all but pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me introduce my nephew,” said Mr. Morgan, as Cyril
strolled up. “And this is my daughter. How now, Florence,
have you found your boxes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Allow me,” said Frithiof; “if you will tell me what to
look for I will see that the hotel porter takes it all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a general adjournment to the region of pushing
and confusion and luggage, and before long Frithiof had taken
the travelers to his father’s carriage, and they were driving
through the long, picturesque Strand-gaden. Very few vehicles
passed through this main street, but throngs of pedestrians
walked leisurely along or stood in groups talking and laughing,
the women chiefly wearing full skirts of dark-blue serge, short
jackets to match, and little round blue serge hoods surmounting
their clean white caps; the men also in dark-blue with broad
felt hats.</p>

<p class='c000'>To English visitors there is an indescribable charm in the
primitive simplicity, the easy informality of the place: and
Frithiof was well content with the delighted exclamations of
the new-comers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What charming ponies!” cried Blanche. “Look how oddly
their manes are cut—short manes and long tails! How funny!
we do just the opposite. And they all seem cream colored.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This side, Blanche, quick! A lot of peasants in sabots!
and oh! just look at those lovely red gables!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How nice the people look, too, so different to people in an
English street. What makes you all so happy over here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, what should make us unhappy?” said Frithiof.
“We love our country and our town, we are the freest people
in the world, and life is a great pleasure in itself, don’t you
think? But away in the mountains our people are much more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>grave. Life is too lonely there. Here in Bergen it is perfection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cyril Morgan regarded the speaker with a pitying eye, and
perhaps would have enlightened his absurd ignorance and discoursed
of Pall Mall and Piccadilly, had not they just then arrived
at Holdt’s Hotel. Frithiof merely waited to see that
they approved of their rooms, gave them the necessary information
as to bankers and lionizing, received Mr. Morgan’s assurance
that the whole party would dine at Herr Falck’s the
next day, and then, having previously dismissed the carriage,
set out at a brisker pace than usual on his walk home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blanche Morgan’s surprise at the happy-looking people
somehow amused him. Was it then an out-of-the-way thing
for people to enjoy life? For his own part mere existence
satisfied him. But then he was as yet quite unacquainted with
trouble. The death of his mother when he was only eleven
years old had been at the time a great grief, but it had in no
way clouded his after-life, he had been scarcely old enough to
realize the greatness of his loss. Its effect had been to make
him cling more closely to those who were left to him—to his
father, to his twin-sister Sigrid, and to the little baby Swanhild
(Svarnheel), whose birth had cost so much. The home life
was an extremely happy one to look back on, and now that his
year of absence was over and his education finished it seemed
to him that all was exactly as he would have it. Faintly in
the distance he looked forward to further success and happiness;
being a fervent patriot he hoped some day to be a king’s
minister—the summit of a Norwegian’s ambition; and being
human he had visions of an ideal wife and an ideal home of
his own. But the political career could very well wait, and the
wife too for the matter of that. And yet, as he walked rapidly
along Kong Oscars Gade, through the Stadsport, and past the
picturesque cemeteries which lie on either side of the road, he
saw nothing at all but a vision of the beautiful dark gray eyes
which had glanced up at him so often that afternoon, and in
his mind there echoed the words of one of Bjornson’s poems:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To-day is just a day to my mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>All sunny before and sunny behind,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the ending of the poem he had quite forgotten.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 id='II' class='c005'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Herr Falck lived in one of the pretty, unpretentious houses
in Kalvedalen which are chiefly owned by the rich merchants
of Bergen. The house stood on the right-hand side of the
road, surrounded by a pretty little garden; it was painted a
light-brown color, and, like most Bergen houses, it was built
of wood. In the windows one could see flowers, and beyond
them white muslin curtains, for æstheticism had not yet penetrated
to Norway. The dark-tiled roof was outlined against a
wooded hill rising immediately behind, with here and there
gray rocks peeping through the summer green of the trees,
while in front the chief windows looked on to a pretty terrace
with carefully kept flower-beds, then down the wooded hill-side
to the lake below—the Lungegaardsvand with purple and gray
heights on the further shore, and on one side a break in the
chain of mountains and a lovely stretch of open country. To
the extreme left was the giant Ulriken, sometimes shining and
glistening, sometimes frowning and dark, but always beautiful;
while to the right you caught a glimpse of Bergen with its
quaint cathedral tower, and away in the distance the fjord like
a shining silver band in the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frithiof walked along the grassy terrace he could hear
sounds of music floating from the house; some one was playing
a most inspiriting waltz, and as soon as he had reached the
open French window of his father’s study a quaint pair of dancers
became visible. A slim little girl of ten years old, with
very short petticoats, and very long golden hair braided into a
pigtail, held by the front paws a fine Esquimaux dog, who
seemed quite to enter into the fun and danced and capered most
cleverly, obediently keeping his long pointed nose over his partner’s
shoulder. The effect was so comical that Frithiof stood
laughingly by to watch the performance for fully half a minute,
then, unable to resist his own desire to dance, he unceremoniously
called Lillo the dog away and whirled off little Swanhild
in the rapid waltz which Norwegians delight in. The languid
grace of a London ball-room would have had no charms for
him; his dancing was full of fire and impetuosity, and Swanhild,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>too, danced very well; it had come to them both as
naturally as breathing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is better than Lillo,” admitted the child. “Somehow
he’s so dreadful heavy to get round. Have the English
people come? What are they like?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, they’re middling,” said Frithiof, “all except the niece,
and she is charming.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is she pretty?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Prettier than any one you ever saw in your life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not prettier than Sigrid?” said the little sister confidently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait till you see,” said Frithiof. “She is a brunette and
perfectly lovely. There now!” as the music ceased, “Sigrid
has felt her left ear burning, and knows that we are speaking
evil of her. Let us come to confess.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With his arms still round the child he entered the pretty
bright-looking room to the right. Sigrid was still at the piano,
but she had heard his voice and had turned round with eager
expectation in her face. The brother and sister were very much
alike; each had the same well-cut Greek features, but Frithiof’s
face was broader and stronger, and you could tell at a glance
that he was the more intellectual of the two. On the other
hand, Sigrid possessed a delightful fund of quiet common-sense,
and her judgment was seldom at fault, while, like most
Norwegian girls, she had a most charmingly simple manner,
and an unaffected light-heartedness which it did one good to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well! what news?” she exclaimed. “Have they come all
right? Are they nice?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nice is not the word! charming! beautiful! To-morrow
you will see if I have spoken too strongly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He says she is even prettier than you, Sigrid,” said Swanhild
mischievously. “Prettier than any one we ever saw!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She? Which of them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miss Blanche Morgan, the daughter of the head of the firm,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the other one?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hardly know. I didn’t look at her much; the others all
seemed to me much like ordinary English tourists. But she!—Well,
you will see to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How I wish they were coming to-night! you make me quite
curious. And father seems so excited about their coming. I
have not seen him so much pleased about anything for a long
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is he at home?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, he went for a walk; his head was bad again. That is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the only thing that troubles me about him, his headaches seem
to have become almost chronic this last year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A shade came over her bright face, and Frithiof too, looked
grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He works very much too hard,” he said, “but as soon as
I come of age and am taken into partnership he will be more
free to take a thorough rest. At present I might just as well
be in Germany as far as work goes, for he will hardly let me do
anything to help him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here he comes, here he comes!” cried Swanhild, who had
wandered away to the window, and with one accord they all
ran out to meet the head of the house, Lillo bounding on in
front and springing up at his master with a loving greeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Herr Falck was a very pleasant-looking man of about fifty;
he had the same well-chiseled features as Frithiof, the same
broad forehead, clearly marked, level brows, and flexible lips,
but his eyes had more of gray and less of blue in them, and
a practiced observer would have detected in their keen glance
an anxiety which could not wholly disguise itself. His hair
and whiskers were iron-gray, and he was an inch or two shorter
than his son. They all stood talking together at the door, the
English visitors still forming the staple of conversation, and the
anxiety giving place to eager hope in Herr Falck’s eyes as
Frithiof once more sung the praises of Blanche Morgan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have they formed any plan for their tour?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; they mean to talk it over with you and get your advice.
They all professed to have a horror of Baedeker, though
even with your help I don’t think they will get far without
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is certain that they will not want to stay very long in our
Bergen,” said Herr Falck, “the English never do. What
should you say now if you all took your summer outing at once
and settled down at Ulvik or Balholm for a few weeks, then
you would be able to see a little of our friends and could start
them well on their tour.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a delightful plan, little father!” cried Sigrid; “only
you must come too, or we shall none of us enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would run over for the Sunday, perhaps; that would be
as much as I could manage; but Frithiof will be there to take
care of you. What should you want with a careworn old man
like me, now that he is at home again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You fish for compliments, little father,” said Sigrid, slipping
her arm within his and giving him one of those mute
caresses which are so much more eloquent than words. “But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>quite between ourselves, though Frithiof is all very well, I
shant enjoy it a bit without you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes, father dear,” said Swanhild, “indeed you must
come, for Frithiof he will be just no good at all; he will be sure
to dance always with the pretty Miss Morgan, and to row her
about on the fjord all day, just as he did those pretty girls at
Norheimsund and Faleide.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The innocent earnestness of the child’s tone made them all
laugh, and Frithiof, vowing vengeance on her for her speech,
chased her round and round the garden, their laughter floating
back to Herr Falck and Sigrid as they entered the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The little minx!” said Herr Falck, “how innocently she
said it, too! I don’t think our boy is such a desperate flirt
though. As far as I remember, there was nothing more than a
sort of boy and girl friendship at either place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh no,” said Sigrid, smiling. “Frithiof was too much of a
school-boy, every one liked him and he liked every one. I
don’t think he is the sort of man to fall in love easily.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; but when it does come it will be a serious affair. I
very much wish to see him happily married.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, father! surely not yet. He is so young, we can’t spare
him yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Herr Falck threw himself back in his arm-chair, and mused
for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One need not necessarily lose him,” he replied, “and you
know, Sigrid, I am a believer in early marriages—at least for
my son; I will not say too much about you, little woman, for
as a matter of fact I don’t know how I should ever spare you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t be afraid, little father; you may be very sure I shant
marry till I see a reasonable chance of being happier than I am
at home with you. And when will that be, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stroked her golden hair tenderly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not just yet, Sigrid, let us hope. Not just yet. As to our
Frithiof, shall I tell you of the palace in cloud-land I am building
for him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not that he should marry the pretty Miss Morgan, as Swanhild
calls her?” said Sigrid, with a strange sinking at the heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not? I hear that she is a charming girl, both clever
and beautiful, and indeed it seems to me that he is quite disposed
to fall in love with her at first sight. Of course were
he not properly in love I should never wish him to marry, but
I own that a union between the two houses would be a great
pleasure to me—a great relief.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sighed, and for the first time the anxious look in his eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>attracted Sigrid’s notice. “Father, dear,” she exclaimed, “wont
you tell me what is troubling you? There is something, I
think. Tell me, little father.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked startled, and a slight flush spread over his face; but
when he spoke his voice was reassuring.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A business man often has anxieties which can not be spoken
of, dear child. God knows they weigh lightly enough on some
men; I think I am growing old, Sigrid, and perhaps I have
never learned to take things so easily as most merchants do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, father, you were only fifty last birthday; you must
not talk yet of growing old. How do other men learn, do you
think, to take things lightly?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By refusing to listen to their own conscience,” said Herr
Falck, with sudden vehemence. “By allowing themselves to
hold one standard of honor in private life and a very different
standard in business transactions. Oh, Sigrid! I would give
a great deal to find some other opening for Frithiof. I dread
the life for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think it is really so hard to be strictly honorable in
business life? And yet it is a life that must be lived, and is it
not better that such a man as Frithiof should take it up—a
man with such a high sense of honor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t know what business men have to stand against,”
said Herr Falck. “Frithiof is a good, honest fellow, but as
yet he has seen nothing of life. And I tell you, child, we often
fail in our strongest point.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose from his chair and paced the room; it seemed to
Sigrid that a nameless shadow had fallen on their sunny home.
She was for the first time in her life afraid, though the fear was
vague and undefined.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But there, little one,” said her father, turning toward her
again. “You must not be worried. I get nervous and depressed,
that is all. As I told you, I am growing old.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof would like to help you more if you would let him,”
said Sigrid, rather wistfully. “He was saying so just now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so he shall in the autumn. He is a good lad, and if
all goes well I hope he will some day be my right hand in the
business; but I wish him to have a few months’ holiday first.
And there is this one thing, Sigrid, which I can tell you, if you
really want to know about my anxieties.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed I do, little father,” she said eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are matters which you would not understand even
could I speak of them; but you know, of course, that I am
agent in Norway for the firm of Morgan Brothers. Well, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>rumor has reached me that they intend to break off the connection
and to send out the eldest son to set up a branch at Stavanger.
It is a mere rumor and reached me quite accidentally.
I very much hope it may not be true, but there is no denying
that Stavanger would be in most ways better suited for their
purpose; in fact, the friend who told me of the rumor said that
they felt now that it had been a mistake all along to have the
agency here and they had only done it because they knew Bergen
and knew me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why is Stavanger a better place for it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is better because most of the salmon and lobsters are
caught in the neighborhood of Stavanger, and all the mackerel
too to the south of Bergen. I very much hope the rumor is
not true, for it would be a great blow to me to lose the English
connection. Still it is not unlikely, and the times are hard
now—very hard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you think your palace in cloud-land for Frithiof would
prevent Mr. Morgan from breaking the connection?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; a marriage between the two houses would be a great
thing, it would make this new idea unlikely if not altogether
impossible. I am thankful that there seems now some chance
of it. Let the two meet naturally and learn to know each
other. I will not say a word to Frithiof, it would only do
harm; but to you, Sigrid, I confess that my heart is set on
this plan. If I could for one moment make you see the
future as I see it, you would feel with me how important the
matter is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment Frithiof himself entered, and the conversation
was abruptly ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, have you decided?” he asked, in his eager, boyish
way. “Is it to be Ulvik or Balholm? What! You were not
even talking about that. Oh, I know what it was then.
Sigrid was deep in the discussion of to-morrow’s dinner. I
will tell you what to do, abolish the romekolle, and let us be
English to the backbone. Now I think of it, Mr. Morgan is
not unlike a walking sirloin with a plum-pudding head. There
is your bill of fare, so waste no more time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The brother and sister went off together, laughing and talking;
but when the door closed behind them the master of the
house buried his face in his hands and for many minutes sat
motionless. What troubled thoughts, what wavering anxieties
filled his mind, Sigrid little guessed. It was, after all, a mere
surface difficulty of which he had spoken; of the real strain
which was killing him by inches he could not say a word to any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>mortal being, though now in his great misery he instinctively
prayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My poor children!” he groaned. “Oh, God spare them
from this shame and ruin which haunts me. I have tried to be
upright and prudent,—it was only this once that I was rash.
Give me success for their sakes, O God! The selfish and
unscrupulous flourish on all sides. Give me this one success.
Let me not blight their whole lives.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the next day, when he went forward to greet his English
guests, it would have been difficult to recognize him as the
burdened, careworn man from whose lips had been wrung that
confession and that prayer. All his natural courtesy and
brightness had returned to him; if he thought of his business
at all he thought of it in the most sanguine way possible, and
the Morgans saw in him only an older edition of Frithiof, and
wondered how he had managed to preserve such buoyant spirits
in the cares and uncertainties of mercantile life. The two
o’clock dinner passed off well; Sigrid, who was a clever little
housekeeper, had scouted Frithiof’s suggestion as to the roast
beef and plum-pudding, and had carefully devised a thoroughly
Norwegian repast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For I thought,” she explained afterwards to Blanche, when
the two girls had made friends, “that if I went to England I
should wish to see your home life just exactly as it really is,
and so I have ordered the sort of dinner we should naturally
have, and did not, as Frithiof advised, leave out the romekolle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was that the stuff like curds and whey?” asked Blanche,
who was full of eager interest in everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes: it is sour cream with bread crumbs grated over it.
We always have a plateful each at dinner, it is quite one of our
customs. But everything here is simple of course, not grand as
with you; we do not keep a great number of servants, or dine
late, or dress for the evening—here there is nothing”—she
hesitated for a word, then in her pretty foreign English added,
“nothing ceremonious.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is just the charm of it all,” said Blanche, in her sweet
gracious way. “It is all so real and simple and fresh, and I
think it was delightful of you to know how much best we should
like to have a glimpse of your real home life instead of a stupid
party. Now mamma cares for nothing but just to make a
great show, it doesn’t matter whether the visitors really like
it or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid felt a momentary pang of doubt; she had fallen in
love with Blanche Morgan the moment she saw her, but it somehow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>hurt her to hear the English girl criticise her own mother.
To Sigrid’s loyal nature there was something out of tune in
that last remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps you and your cousin would like to see over the
house,” she said, by way of making a diversion. “Though I
must tell you that we are considered here in Bergen to be
rather English in some points. That is because of my father’s
business connection with England, I suppose. Here, you see,
in his study he has a real English fireplace; we all like it much
better than the stoves, and some day I should like to have them
in the other rooms as well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But there is one thing very un-English,” said Blanche.
“There are no passages; instead, I see, all your rooms open
out of each other. Such numbers of lovely plants, too, in
every direction; we are not so artistic, we stand them all in
prim rows in a conservatory. This, too, is quite new to me.
What a good idea!” And she went up to examine a prettily
worked sling fastened to the wall, and made to hold newspapers.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was too polite, of course, to say what really struck her—that
the whole house seemed curiously simple and bare, and
that she had imagined that one of the leading merchants of Bergen
would live in greater style. As a matter of fact, you might,
as Cyril expressed it, have bought the whole place for an old
song, and though there was an air of comfort and good taste
about the rooms and a certain indescribable charm, they were
evidently destined for use and not for show, and with the exception
of some fine old Norwegian silver and a few good pictures
Herr Falck did not possess a single thing of value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Contrasted with the huge and elaborately furnished house in
Lancaster Gate with its lavishly strewn knick-knacks, its profusion
of all the beautiful things that money could buy, the
Norwegian villa seemed poor indeed, yet there was something
about it which took Blanche’s fancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later on, when the whole party had started for a walk, and
when Frithiof and Blanche had quite naturally drifted into a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>, she said something to this effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I begin not to wonder that you are so happy,” she added;
“the whole atmosphere of the place is happiness. I wish you
could teach us the secret of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you then only the gift of making other people happy?”
said Frithiof. “That seems strange.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will perhaps think me very discontented,” she said,
with a pathetic little sadness in her tone which touched him;
“but seeing how fresh and simple and happy your life is out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>here makes me more out of heart than ever with my own home.
You must not think I am grumbling; they are very good to me,
you know, and give me everything that money can buy; but
somehow there is so much that jars on one, and here there seems
nothing but kindliness and ease and peace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad you like our life,” he said; “so very glad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And as she told him more of her home and her London life,
and of how little it satisfied her, her words, and still more her
manner and her sweet eyes, seemed to weave a sort of spell
about him, seemed to lure him on into a wonderful future, and
to waken in him a new life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I like him,” thought Blanche to herself. “Perhaps after
all this Norwegian tour will not be so dull. I like to see his
eye light up so eagerly; he really has beautiful eyes! I almost
think—I really almost think I am just a little bit in love with
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment they happened to overtake two English tourists
on the road; as they passed on in front of them Frithiof,
with native courtesy, took off his hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You surely don’t know that man? He is only a shopkeeper,”
said Blanche, not even taking the trouble to lower
her voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof crimsoned to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am afraid he must have heard what you said,” he exclaimed,
quickening his pace in the discomfort of the realization.
“I do not know him certainly, but one is bound to be
courteous to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know exactly who he is,” said Blanche, “for he and his
sister were on the steamer, and Cyril found out all about them.
He is Boniface, the music-shop man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof was saved a reply, for just then they reached their
destination, and rejoined the rest of the party, who were clustered
together on the hill-side enjoying a most lovely view.
Down below them, sheltered by a great craggy mountain on the
further side, lay a little lonely lake, so weird-looking, so desolate,
that it was hard to believe it to be within an easy walk of
the town. Angry-looking clouds were beginning to gather in
the sky, a purple gloom seemed to overspread the mountain and
the lake, and something of its gravity seemed also to have fallen
upon Frithiof. He had found the first imperfection in his ideal,
yet it had only served to show him how great a power, how
strange an influence she possessed over him. He knew now
that, for the first time in his life, he was blindly, desperately in
love.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Why, it is beginning to rain,” said Mr. Morgan. “I almost
think we had better be turning back, Herr Falck. It has
been a most enjoyable little walk; but if we can reach the hotel
before it settles in for a wet evening, why, all the better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The rain is the great drawback to Bergen,” said Herr
Falck. “At Christiania they have a saying that when you go
to Bergen it rains three hundred and sixty-six days out of
the year. But after all one becomes very much accustomed
to it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the return walk the conversation was more general, and
though Frithiof walked beside Blanche he said very little. His
mind was full of the new idea which had just dawned upon him,
and he heard her merry talk with Sigrid and Swanhild like a
man in a dream. Before long, much to his discomfort, he saw
in front of them the two English tourists, and though his mind
was all in a tumult with this new perception of his love for
Blanche, yet the longing to make up for her ill-judged remark,
the desire to prove that he did not share in her prejudice, was
powerful too. He fancied it was chiefly to avoid them that the
Englishman turned toward the bank just as they passed to
gather a flower which grew high above his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What can this be, Cecil?” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Allow me, sir,” said Frithiof, observing that it was just out
of the stranger’s reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was two or three inches taller, and, with an adroit spring,
was able to bring down the flower in triumph. By this time
the others were some little way in advance. He looked rather
wistfully after Blanche, and fancied disapproval in her erect,
trim little figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the Linnæa,” he explained. “You will find a great
deal of it about. It was the flower, you know, which Linnæus
chose to name after himself. Some say he showed his modesty
in choosing so common and insignificant a plant, but it always
seems to me that he showed his good taste. It is a beautiful
flower.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy Boniface thanked him heartily for his help. “We were
hoping to find the Linnæa,” he said, handing it to his sister,
while he opened a specimen tin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What delicate little bells!” she exclaimed. “I quite agree
with you that Linnæus showed his good taste.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof would probably have passed on had he not, at that
moment, recognized Cecil as the English girl whom he had first
accosted on the steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me for not knowing you before,” he said, raising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>his hat. “We met yesterday afternoon, did we not? I hope
you have had a pleasant time at Bergen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Delightful, thank you. We think it the most charming
town we ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barring the rain,” said Roy, “for which we have foolishly
forgotten to reckon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never be parted from your umbrella is a sound maxim for
this part of the world,” said Frithiof, smiling. “Halloo! it is
coming down in good earnest. I’m afraid you will get very
wet,” he said, glancing at Cecil’s pretty gray traveling
dress.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall we stand up for a minute under that porch, Roy?”
said the girl, glancing at a villa which they were just passing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” said Frithiof: “please take shelter with us. My
father’s villa is close by. Please come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And since Cecil was genuinely glad not to get wet through,
and since Roy, though he cared nothing for the rain, was glad
to have a chance of seeing the inside of a Norwegian villa,
they accepted the kindly offer, and followed their guide into
the pretty, snug-looking house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy had heard a good deal of talk about sweetness and
light, but he thought he had never realized the meaning of the
words till the moment when he was ushered into that pretty Norwegian
drawing-room, with its painted floor and groups of
flowers, and its pink-tinted walls, about which the green ivy
wreathed itself picturesquely, now twining itself round some
mirror or picture-frame, now forming a sort of informal frieze
round the whole room, its roots so cleverly hidden away in
sheltered corners or on unobtrusive brackets that the growth
had all the fascination of mystery. The presiding genius of
the place, and the very center of all that charmed, stood by
one of the windows, the light falling on her golden hair. She
had taken off her hat and was flicking the rain-drops from it
with her handkerchief when Frithiof introduced the two Bonifaces,
and Roy, who found his novel experience a little embarrassing,
was speedily set at ease by her delightful naturalness
and frank courtesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her bow and smile were grace itself, and she seemed to take
the whole proceeding entirely as a matter of course; one might
have supposed that she was in the habit of sheltering wet tourists
every day of her life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am so glad my brother found you,” she exclaimed.
“You would have been wet through had you walked on to Bergen.
Swanhild, run and fetch a duster; oh, you have brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>one already, that’s a good child. Now let me wipe your
dress,” she added, turning to Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where has every one disappeared to?” asked Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Father has walked on to Holdt’s Hotel with the Morgans,”
said Swanhild. “They would not wait, though we tried
to persuade them to. Father is going to talk over their route
with them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil saw a momentary look of annoyance on his face; but
the next minute he was talking as pleasantly as possible to
Roy, and before long the question of routes was being discussed,
and as fast as Frithiof suggested one place, Sigrid and
Swanhild mentioned others which must on no account be
missed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you can really only spare a month for it all?” asked
Sigrid. “Then I should give up going to Christiania or
Trondhjem if I were you. They will not interest you half as
much as this southwest coast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, Sigrid, it is impossible to leave out Kongswold and
Dombaas. For you are a botanist, are you not?” said Frithiof,
turning to the Englishman, “and those places are perfection
for flowers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes? Then you must certainly go there,” said Sigrid.
“Kongswold is a dear little place up on the Dovrefjeld. Yet
if you were not botanists I should say you ought to see instead
either the Vöringsfos or the Skjaeggedalsfos, they are our two
finest waterfalls.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Skedaddle-fos, as the Americans call it,” put in
Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have a great many American tourists, I suppose,”
said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, a great many, and we like them very well, though
not as we like the English. To the English we feel very
much akin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you speak our language so well!” said Cecil, to
whom the discovery had been a surprise and a relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see we Norwegians think a great deal of education.
Our schools are very good; we are all taught to speak German
and English. French, which with you comes first, does it not?
stands third with us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me about your schools,” said Cecil. “Are they like
ours, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We begin at six years old to go to the middle school—they
say it is much like your English high schools; both my brother
and I went to the middle schools here at Bergen. Then when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>we were sixteen we went to Christiania, he to the Handelsgymnasium,
and I to Miss Bauer’s school, for two years. My
little sister is now at the middle school here; she goes every
day, but just now it is holiday time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And in holidays,” said Swanhild, whose English was much
less fluent and ready, “we go away. We perhaps go to-morrow
to Balholm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps we shall meet you again there,” said Sigrid. “Oh,
do come there; it is such a lovely place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then followed a discussion about flowers, in which Sigrid was
also interested, and presently Herr Falck returned, and added
another picture of charming hospitality to the group that would
always remain in the minds of the English travelers; and then
there was afternoon tea, which proved a great bond of union
and more discussion of English and Norwegian customs, and
much laughter and merriment and light-heartedness.</p>

<p class='c000'>When at length the rain ceased and Roy and Cecil were
allowed to leave for Bergen, they felt as if the kindly Norwegians
were old friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall you be very much disappointed if we give up the
Skedaddle-fos?” asked Roy. “It seems to me that a water-fall
is a water-fall all the world over, but that we are not likely
to meet everywhere with a family like that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, by all means give it up,” said Cecil gayly. “I would
far rather have a few quiet days at Balholm. I detest toiling
after the things every one expects you to see. Besides, we can
always be sure of finding the Skjaeggedalsfos in Norway, but
we can’t tell what may happen to these delightful people.”</p>

  <h2 id='III' class='c005'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Balholm, the loveliest of all the places on the Sogne Fjord,
is perhaps the quietest place on earth. There is a hotel, kept
by two most delightful Norwegian brothers; there is a bathing-house,
a minute landing-stage, and a sprinkling of little
wooden cottages with red-tiled roofs. The only approach is by
water; no dusty high-road is to be found, no carts and carriages
rumble past; if you want rest and quiet, you have only
to seek it on the mountains or by the shore; if you want
amusement, you have only to join the merry Norwegians in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</span></i>, who are always ready to sing or to play, to dance or to
talk, or, if weather-bound, to play games with the zest and animation
of children. Even so limp a specimen of humanity as
Cyril Morgan found that, after all, existence in this primitive
region had its charms, while Blanche said, quite truthfully,
that she had never enjoyed herself so much in her life. There
was to her a charming piquancy about both place and people;
and although she was well accustomed to love and admiration,
she found that Frithiof was altogether unlike the men she
had hitherto met in society; there was about him something
strangely fresh—he seemed to harmonize well with the place,
and he made all the other men of whom she could think seem
ordinary and prosaic. As for Frithiof he made no secret of his
love for her, it was apparent to all the world—to the light-hearted
Norwegians, who looked on approvingly; to Cyril
Morgan, who wondered what on earth Blanche could see in
such an unsophisticated boy; to Mr. Morgan, who, with a
shrug of his broad shoulders, remarked that there was no help
for it—it was Blanche’s way; to Roy Boniface, who thought
the two were well matched, and gave them his good wishes;
and to Cecil, who, as she watched the two a little wistfully,
said in her secret heart what could on no account have been
said to any living being, “I hope, oh, I hope she cares for him
enough!”</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning, a little tired with the previous day’s excursion
to the Suphelle Brae, they idled away the sunny hours on the
fjord, Frithiof rowing, Swanhild lying at full length in the bow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>with Lillo mounting guard over her, and Blanche, Sigrid, and
Cecil in the stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have been all this time at Balholm and yet have not
seen King Bele’s grave!” Frithiof had exclaimed in answer to
Blanche’s inquiry. “Look, here it is, just a green mound by
that tree.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Isn’t it odd,” said Sigrid dreamily, “to think that we are
just in the very place where the Frithiof Saga was really
lived?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I thought it was only a legend,” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no,” said Frithiof, “the Sagas are not legends, but
true stories handed down by word of mouth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I wish you would hand down your saga to us by
word of mouth,” said Blanche, raising her sweet eyes to his.
“I shall never take the trouble to read it for myself in some
dry, tiresome book. Tell us the story of Frithiof now as we
drift along in the boat with his old home Framnaes in sight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not think I can tell it really well,” he said: “but I
can just give you the outline of it:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof was the only son of a wealthy yeoman who owned
land at Framnaes. His father was a great friend of King
Bele, and the king wished that his only daughter Ingeborg
should be educated by the same wise man who taught Frithiof,
so you see it happened that as children Frithiof and Ingeborg
were always together, and by and by was it not quite natural
that they should learn to love each other? It happened
just so, and Frithiof vowed that, although he was only the son
of a yeoman, nothing should separate them or make him give
her up. It then happened that King Bele died, and Frithiof’s
father, his great friend, died at the same time. Then Frithiof
went to live at Framnaes over yonder; he had great possessions,
but the most useful were just these three; a wonderful
sword, a wonderful bracelet, and a wonderful ship called the
‘Ellida,’ which had been given to one of his Viking ancestors
by the sea-god. But though he had all these things,
and was the most powerful man in the kingdom, yet he was
always sad, for he could not forget the old days with Ingeborg.
So one day he crossed this fjord to Bele’s grave, close
to Balholm, where Ingeborg’s two brothers Helge and Halfdan
were holding an assembly of the people, and he boldly
asked for Ingeborg’s hand. Helge the King was furious,
and rejected him with scorn, and Frithiof, who would not
allow even a king to insult him, drew his sword and with one
blow smote the King’s shield, which hung on a tree, in two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>pieces. Soon after this good King Ring of the far North,
who had lost his wife, became a suitor for Ingeborg’s hand;
but Helge and Halfdan insulted his messengers and a war
was the consequence. When Frithiof heard the news of the
war he was sitting with his friend at a game of chess; he
refused to help Helge and Halfdan, but knowing that Ingeborg
had been sent for safety to the sacred grove of Balder, he
went to see her in the ‘Ellida,’ though there was a law that
whoever ventured to approach the grove by water should be
put to death. Now Ingeborg had always loved him and she
agreed to be betrothed to him, and taking leave of her, Frithiof
went with all haste to tell her brothers. This time also
there was a great assembly at Bele’s grave, and again Frithiof
asked for the hand of Ingeborg, and promised that, if Helge
would consent to their betrothal, he would fight for him. But
Helge, instead of answering him, asked if he had not been to
the sacred grove of Balder contrary to the law? Then all the
people shouted to him, ‘Say no, Frithiof! Say no, and Ingeborg
is yours.’ But Frithiof said that though his happiness hung
on that one word he would not tell a lie, that in truth he had
been to Balder’s Temple, but that his presence had not defiled
it, that he and Ingeborg had prayed together and had planned
this offer of peace. But the people forsook him, and King
Helge banished him until he should bring back the tribute due
from Angantyr of the Western Isles; and every one knew that
if he escaped with his life on such an errand it would be a
wonder. Once again Frithiof saw Ingeborg, and he begged
her to come with him in his ship the ‘Ellida,’ but Ingeborg,
though she loved him, thought that she owed obedience to her
brothers, and they bade each other farewell; but before he
went Frithiof clasped on her arm the wonderful bracelet. So
then they parted, and Frithiof sailed away and had more adventures
than I can tell you, but at last he returned with the
tribute money, and now he thought Ingeborg would indeed
be his. But when he came in sight of Framnaes, he found
that his house and everything belonging to him had been
burned to the ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, Frithiof; there was his horse and his dog left,”
corrected Sigrid. “Don’t you remember how they came up to
him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So they did, but all else was gone; and, worst of all, Ingeborg,
they told him, had been forced by her brothers to marry
King Ring, who, if she had not become his wife, would have
taken the kingdom from Helge and Halfdan. Then Frithiof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>was in despair, and cried out, ‘Who dare speak to me of
the fidelity of women?’ And it so happened that that very
day was Midsummer-day, and he knew that King Helge,
Ingeborg’s brother, would be in the Temple of Balder. He
sought him out, and went straight up to him and said, ‘You
sent me for the lost tribute and I have gained it, but either you
or I must die. Come, fight me! Think of Framnaes that you
burned. Think of Ingeborg whose life you have spoiled!’
And then in great wrath he flung the tribute-money at Helge’s
head, and Helge fell down senseless. Just then Frithiof
caught sight of the bracelet he had given Ingeborg on the
image of Balder, and he tore it off, but in so doing upset the
image, which fell into the flames on the altar. The fire spread,
and spread so that at last the whole temple was burned, and
all the trees of the grove. Next day King Helge gave chase
to Frithiof, but luckily in the night Frithiof’s friend had scuttled
all the King’s ships, and so his effort failed, and Frithiof
sailed out to sea in the ‘Ellida.’ Then he became a Viking,
and lived a hard life, and won many victories. At last he
came home to Norway and went to King Ring’s court at
Yule-tide, disguised as an old man; but they soon found out
that he was young and beautiful, and he doffed his disguise,
and Ingeborg trembled as she recognized him. Ring knew
him not, but liked him well, and made him his guest. One
day he saved Ring when his horse and sledge had fallen into
the water. But another day it so happened that they went out
hunting together, and Ring being tired fell asleep, while Frithiof
kept guard over him. As he watched, a raven came and sung
to him, urging him to kill the King; but a white bird urged
him to flee from temptation, and Frithiof drew his sword and
flung it far away out of reach. Then the King opened his eyes,
and told Frithiof that for some time he had known him, and
that he honored him for resisting temptation. Frithiof, however,
felt that he could no longer bear to be near Ingeborg,
since she belonged not to him, and soon he came to take leave
of her and her husband. But good King Ring said that the
time of his own death was come, and he asked Frithiof to take
his kingdom and Ingeborg, and to be good to his son. Then
he plunged his sword in his breast, and so died. Before long
the people met to elect a new king, and would have chosen
Frithiof, but he would only be regent till Ring’s son should be
of age. Then Frithiof went away to his father’s grave, and
prayed to Balder, and he built a wonderful new temple for the
god, but still peace did not come to him. And the priest told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>him that the reason of this was because he still kept anger and
hatred in his heart toward Ingeborg’s brothers. Helge was
dead, but the priest prayed him to be reconciled to Halfdan.
They were standing thus talking in the new temple when Halfdan
unexpectedly appeared, and when he caught sight of his
foe, he turned pale and trembled. But Frithiof, who for the
first time saw that forgiveness is greater than vengeance,
walked up to the altar, placed upon it his sword and shield,
and returning, held out his hand to Halfdan, and the two were
reconciled. At that moment there entered the temple one
dressed as a bride, and Frithiof lifted up his eyes and saw that
it was Ingeborg herself. And Halfdan, his pride of birth forgotten
and his anger conquered by his foe’s forgiveness, led
his sister to Frithiof and gave her to be his wife, and in the
new Temple of Balder the Good the lovers received the blessing
of the priest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How well you tell it! It is a wonderful story,” said Blanche;
and there was real, genuine pleasure in her dark eyes as she
looked across at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was such a contrast to her ordinary life, this quiet Norway,
where all was so simple and true and trustworthy, where
no one seemed to strain after effects. And there was something
in Frithiof’s strength, and spirit, and animation which
appealed to her greatly. “My Viking is adorable!” she used
to say to herself; and gradually there stole into her manner
toward him a sort of tender reverence. She no longer teased
him playfully, and their talks together in those long summer
days became less full of mirth and laughter, but more earnest
and absorbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil saw all this, and she breathed more freely. “Certainly
she loves him,” was her reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid, too, no longer doubted; indeed, Blanche had altogether
won her heart, and somehow, whenever they were together,
the talk always drifted round to Frithiof’s past, or
Frithiof’s future, or Frithiof’s opinions. She was very happy
about it, for she felt sure that Blanche would be a charming
sister-in-law, and love and hope seemed to have developed
Frithiof in a wonderful way; he had suddenly grown manly
and considerate, nor did Sigrid feel, as she had feared, that his
new love interfered with his love for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were bright days for every one, those days at Balholm,
with their merry excursions to the priest’s garden and the fir-woods,
to the saeter on the mountain-side, and to grand old
Munkeggen, whose heights towered above the little wooden hotel.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Herr Falck, who had joined them toward the end of the
week, and who climbed Munkeggen as energetically as any one,
was well pleased to see the turn affairs had taken; and every
one was kind, and discreetly left Frithiof and Blanche to themselves
as they toiled up the mountain-side; indeed, Knut, the
landlord’s brother, who as usual had courteously offered his
services as guide, was so thoughtful for the two lovers who
were lingering behind, that he remorselessly hurried up a stout
old American lady, who panted after him, to that “Better
resting-place,” which he always insisted was a little further on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will there be church to-morrow?” asked Blanche, as they
rested half-way. “I should so like to go to a Norwegian service.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There will be service at some church within reach,” said
Frithiof; “but I do not much advise you to go; it will be very
hot, and the place will be packed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why? Are you such a religious people?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The peasants are,” he replied. “And of course the women.
Church-going and religion, that is for women; we men do not
need that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a little startled by his matter-of-fact, unabashed tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What, are you an agnostic? an atheist?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, not at all,” he said composedly. “I believe in
a good Providence but with so much I am quite satisfied, you
see. What does one need with more? To us men religion,
church-going, is—is—how do you call it in English? I think
you say ‘An awful bore,’ Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The slang in foreign accent was irresistible. She was a little
shocked, but she could not help laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How you Norwegians speak out!” she exclaimed. “Many
Englishmen feel that, but few would say it so plainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So! I thought an Englishman was nothing if not candid.
But for me I feel no shame. What more would one have than
to make the most of life? That is my religion. I hear that in
England there is a book to ask whether life is worth living? For
me I can’t understand that sort of thing. It is a question that
would never have occurred to me. Only to live is happiness
enough. Life is such a very good thing. Do you not
agree?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sometimes,” she said, rather wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only sometimes? No, no, always—to the last breath!”
cried Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You say that because things are as you like; because you
are happy,” said Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“It is true, I am very happy,” he replied. “Who would not
be happy walking with you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in his manner frightened her a little. She went
on breathlessly and incoherently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You wouldn’t say that life is a very good thing if you were
like our poor people in East London, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, no,” he said gravely. “That must be a great
blot on English life. Here in Norway we have no extremes.
No one is very poor, and our richest men have only what would
be counted in England a moderate income.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps that is why you are such a happy people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps,” said Frithiof, but he felt little inclined to consider
the problem of the distribution of wealth just then, and the
talk drifted round once more to that absorbing personal talk
which was much more familiar to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length the top of the mountain was reached, and a merry
little picnic ensued. Frithiof was the life of the party, and
there was much drinking of healths and clinking of glasses, and
though the cold was intense every one seemed to enjoy it, and
to make fun of any sort of discomfort.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come!” said Sigrid to Cecil Boniface, “you and I must add
a stone to the cairn. Let us drag up this great one and put it
on the top together in memory of our friendship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They stood laughing and panting under the shelter of the
cairn when the stone was deposited, the merry voices of the
rest of the party floating back to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you not think we are dreadful chatterers, we Norwegians?”
said Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think you are delightful,” said Cecil simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in her manner touched and pleased Sigrid. She
had grown to like this quiet English girl. They were silent
for some minutes, looking over that wonderful expanse of blue
fjords and hoary mountains, flecked here and there on their
somber heights by snow-drifts. Far down below them a row-boat
could be seen on the water, looking scarcely bigger than
the head of a pin: and as Cecil watched the lovely country
steeped in the golden sunshine of that summer afternoon,
thoughts of the Frithiof Saga came thronging through her
mind, till it almost seemed to her that in another moment she
should see the dragon ship the “Ellida,” winging her way over
the smooth blue waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knut suggested before long that if they were to be home in
time for supper it might be best to start at once, and the merry
party broke up into little groups. Herr Falck was deep in conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>with Mr. Morgan, Cyril and Florence as usual kept
to themselves, Knut piloted the American lady in advance
of the others, while Roy Boniface joined his sister and Sigrid,
pausing on the way for a little snow-balling in a great snowdrift
just below the summit. Little Swanhild hesitated for a
moment, longing to walk with Blanche, for whom she had formed
the sort of adoring attachment with which children of her age
often honor some grown-up girl; but she was laughingly carried
off by some good-natured friends from Bergen, who divined
her intentions, and once more Frithiof and Blanche were
left alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you must really go on Monday?” asked Frithiof, with
a sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” she said, glancing up at him quickly, “I have been
very troublesome to you, I’m sure—always needing help in
climbing! You will be glad to get rid of me, though you are
too polite to tell me so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can you say such things?” he exclaimed, and again
something in his manner alarmed her a little. “You know—you
must know what these days have been to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The lovely color flooded her cheeks, and she spoke almost
at random.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After all, I believe I should do better if I trusted to my alpenstock!”
And laughingly she began to spring down the rough
descent, a little proud of her own grace and agility, and a little
glad to baffle and tease him for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take care! take care!” cried Frithiof, hurrying after her.
Then, with a stifled cry, he sprang forward to rescue her, for
the alpenstock had slipped on a stone, and she was rolling
down the steep incline. Even in the terrible moment itself he
had time to think of two distinct dangers—she might strike
her head against one of the bowlders, or, worse thought still,
might be unchecked, and fall over that side of Munkeggen
which was almost precipitous. How he managed it he never
realized, but love seemed to lend him wings, and the next thing
he knew was that he was kneeling on the grass only two or three
feet from the sheer cliff-like side, with Blanche in his arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you hurt?” he questioned breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she replied, trembling with excitement. “Not hurt
at all, only shaken and startled.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He lifted her a little further from the edge. For a minute
she lay passively, then she looked up into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How strong you are,” she said, “and how cleverly you
caught me! Yet now that it is over you look quite haggard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and white. I am really not hurt at all. It punished me well
for thinking I could get on without you. You see I couldn’t!”
and a lovely, tender smile dawned in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sat up and took off her hat, smoothing back her disordered
hair. A sort of terror seized Frithiof that in another
minute she would propose going on, and, urged by this fear,
he spoke rapidly and impetuously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If only I might always serve you!” he cried. “Oh, Blanche,
I love you! I love you! Will you not trust yourself to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Blanche had received already several offers of marriage;
they had been couched in much better terms, but they had
lacked the passionate ardor of Frithiof’s manner. All in a moment
she was conquered; she could not even make a feint of
resistance, but just put her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will always trust you,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as she felt his strong arm round her and his kisses on
her cheek, there flashed through her mind a description she
had once read of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“a strong man from the North,</div>
      <div class='line'>Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous gray.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was a love worth having, she thought to herself; a love to
be proud of!</p>

<p class='c000'>“But Frithiof,” she began, after a timeless pause, “we must
keep our secret just for a little while. You see my father is
not here, and—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me write to him and ask his consent,” exclaimed
Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, do not write. Come over to England in October
and see him yourself, that will be so much better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Must we wait so long?” said Frithiof, his face clouding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is only a few weeks; papa will not be at home till then.
Every one is away from London, you know. Don’t look so
anxious; I do not know your face when it isn’t happy—you
were never meant to be grave. As for papa, I can make him
do exactly what I like, you need not be afraid that he will not
consent. Come! I have promised to trust to you, and yet
you doubt me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Doubt you!” he cried. “Never! I trust you, before all
the world; and if you tell me to wait—why then—I must
obey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How I love you for saying that,” cried Blanche, clinging
to him. “To think that you who are so strong should say that
to me! It seems wonderful. But indeed, indeed, you need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>not doubt me. I love you with my whole heart. I love you
as I never thought it possible to love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof again clasped her in his arms, and there came to his
mind the sweet words of Uhland:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gestorben war ich</span></div>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“We were beginning to think some accident had happened
to you,” said Sigrid, who stood waiting at the door of the
hotel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so it did,” said Blanche, laughing, “I think I should
have broken my neck if it hadn’t been for your brother. It
was all the fault of this treacherous alpenstock which played
me false.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, with a sympathetic little group of listeners, Blanche
gave a full account of her narrow escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you are really not hurt at all? Not too much shaken
to care to dance to-night?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a bit,” said Blanche merrily. “And you promised
to put on your peasant costume and show us the <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">spring dans</span></i>,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I did. I must make haste and dress, then,” and Sigrid
ran upstairs, appearing again before long in a simply made
dark skirt, white sleeves and chemisette, and red bodice, richly
embroidered in gold. Her beautiful hair was worn in two
long plaits down her back, and the costume suited her to perfection.
There followed a merry supper in the <em>dépendence</em>
where all meals were served; then every one adjourned to the
hotel <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</span></i>, the tables and chairs were hastily pushed aside,
and dancing began.</p>

<p class='c000'>Herr Falck’s eyes rested contentedly on the slim little figure
in the maize-colored dress who so often danced with his
son; and, indeed, Blanche looked more lovely than ever that
evening, for happiness and excitement had brightened her
dark eyes, and deepened the glow of color in her cheeks.
The father felt proud, too, of his children, when, in response
to the general entreaty, Frithiof and Sigrid danced the <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">spring
dans</span></i> together with its graceful evolutions and quaint gestures.
Then nothing would do but Frithiof must play to them on
the violin, after which Blanche volunteered to teach every
one Sir Roger de Coverly, and old and young joined merrily
in the country dance, and so the evening passed on all
too rapidly to its close. It was a scene which somehow lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>on in Cecil’s memory; the merry dancers, the kindly landlord,
Ole Kvikne, sitting near the door and watching them, the expression
of content visible in Herr Falck’s face as he sat beside
him, the pretty faces and picturesque attire of Sigrid and
Swanhild, the radiant beauty of Blanche Morgan, the unclouded
happiness of Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evening had done her good; its informality, its hearty
unaffected happiness and merriment made it a strange contrast
to any other dance she could recollect; yet even here there was
a slight shadow. She could not forget those words which she
had overheard on board the steamer, could not get rid of the
feeling that some trouble hung over the Falck family, and
that hidden away, even in this Norwegian paradise, there
lurked somewhere the inevitable serpent. Even as she mused
over it, Frithiof crossed the room and made his bow before
her, and in another minute had whirled her off. Happiness
shone in his eyes, lurked in the tones of his voice, added
fresh spirit to his dancing; she thought she had never before
seen such an incarnation of perfect content. They talked of
Norwegian books, and her interest in his country seemed to
please him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can easily get English translations of our best novelists,”
he said. “You should read Alexander Kielland’s books,
and Bjornsen’s. I have had a poem of Bjornsen’s ringing all
day in my head; we will make Sigrid say it to us, for I only
know the chorus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then as the waltz came to an end he led her toward his sister,
who was standing with Roy near the piano.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We want you to say us Bjornsen’s poem, Sigrid, in which
the refrain is, ‘To-day is just a day to my mind.’ I can’t remember
anything but the chorus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it is rather a horrid little poem,” said Sigrid, hesitating.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, let us have it, please let us have it,” said Blanche,
joining them. “You have made me curious now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So Sigrid, not liking to refuse, repeated first the poem itself
and then the English translation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The fox lay under the birch-tree’s root</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Beside the heather;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the hare bounded with lightsome foot</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘To-day is just a day to my mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>All sunny before and sunny behind</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather!’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>And the fox laughed under the birch-tree’s root</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Beside the heather;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the hare frolicked with heedless foot</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I am so glad about everything!’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘So that is the way you dance and spring</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather!’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And the fox lay in wait by the birch-tree’s root</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Beside the heather;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the hare soon tumbled close to his foot</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Why, bless me! is that <em>you</em>, my dear!</div>
      <div class='line'>However did you come dancing here</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Over the heather?’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“I had forgotten that it ended so tragically,” said Frithiof,
with a slight shrug of the shoulders. “Well, never mind, it is
only a poem; let us leave melancholy to poets and novelists,
and enjoy real life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then a polka was struck up and he hastily made his bow
to Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And yet one needs a touch of tragedy in real life,” she observed,
“or it becomes so dreadfully prosaic.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” said Frithiof, laughing, as he bore her off; “then for
Heaven’s sake let us be prosaic to the end of the chapter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil heard the words, they seemed to her to fit in uncannily
with the words of the poem; she could not have explained,
and she did not try to analyze the little thrill of pain that shot
through her heart at the idea. Neither could she have justified
to herself the shuddering repulsion she felt when Cyril Morgan
drew near, intercepting her view of Frithiof and Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I have the pleasure of this dance?” he said, in his
condescending tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, but I am so tired,” she replied. “Too tired
for any more to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Sigrid, glancing at her. “You look worn out.
Munkeggen is a tiring climb. Let us come upstairs, it is high
time that naughty little sister of mine was in bed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The reward of virtue,” said Cyril Morgan, rejoining his
cousin Florence. “I have been polite to the little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoise</span></i>
and it has cost me nothing. It is always best in a place like
this to be on good terms with every one. We shall never be
likely to come across these people again, the acquaintance is
not likely to bore us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His words were perfectly true. That curiously assorted
gathering of different nationalities would never again meet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>yet those days of close intimacy were destined to influence forever,
either for good or for evil, the lives of each one.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through the Sunday Blanche had kept in bed, for though
the excitement had kept her up, on the previous night, she inevitably
suffered from the effects of her fall. It was not till the
Monday morning, just before the arrival of the steamer, that
Frithiof could find the opportunity for which he had impatiently
waited. They walked through the little garden, ostensibly
to watch for the steamer from the mound by the flagstaff,
but they only lingered there for a minute, glancing anxiously
down the fjord where in the distance could be seen the unwelcome
black speck. On the further side of the mound, down
among the trees and bushes, was a little sheltered seat. It was
there that they spent their last moments, there that Blanche
listened to his eager words of love, there that she again bade
him wait till October, at the same time giving him such hope
and encouragement as must surely have satisfied the most
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exigeant</span></i> lover.</p>

<p class='c000'>All too soon the bustle of departure reached them, and the
steam-whistle—most hateful and discordant of sounds—rang
and resounded among the mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I must go,” she exclaimed, “or they will be coming to look
for me. This is our real good-by. On the steamer it will be
just a hand-shake, but now—”</p>

<p class='c000'>And she lifted a lovely, glowing face to his.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, presently, as they walked down to the little pier, she
talked fast and gayly of all they would do when he came to
England; she talked because, for once, he was absolutely
silent, and because she was afraid that her uncle would guess
their secret; perhaps it was a relief to her that Frithiof volunteered
to run back to the hotel for Mr. Morgan’s opera-glass,
which had been left by mistake in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</span></i>, so that, literally,
there was only time for the briefest of farewells on the steamer.
He went through it all in a business-like fashion, smiling
mechanically in response to the good wishes, then, with a heavy
heart, stepping on shore. Herr Falck, who was returning to
Bergen by the same boat, which took the other travelers only
as far as Vadheim, was not ill pleased to see his son’s evident
dejection; he stood by the bulwarks watching him and saying
a word or two now and then to Blanche, who was close by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why see!” he exclaimed, “the fellow is actually coming
on board again. We shall be carrying him away with us if he
doesn’t take care.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand pardons!” Frithiof had exclaimed, shaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>hands with Cecil and Roy Boniface. “I did not see you
before. A pleasant journey to you. You must come again to
Norway some day, and let us all meet once more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Vaer saa god!</span></i>” exclaimed one of the sailors; and Frithiof
had to spring down the gangway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To our next merry meeting,” said Roy, lifting his hat;
and then there was a general waving of handkerchiefs from
the kindly little crowd on the pier and from the parting guests,
and, in all the babel and confusion, Frithiof was conscious
only of Blanche’s clear “<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Auf wiedersehen!</span></i>” and saw nothing
but the sweet dark eyes, which to the very last dwelt on
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, that is over!” he said to Sigrid, pulling himself
together, and stifling a sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps they will come here next year,” suggested Sigrid
consolingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps I shall go to England next autumn,” said Frithiof
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So soon!” she exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed, for the words were such a curious contradiction
to the ones which lurked in his own mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! you call two months a short time!” he exclaimed;
“and to me it seems an eternity. You will have to be very
forbearing, for I warn you such a waiting time is very little to
my taste.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then why did you not speak now, before she went away?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You wisest of advisers!” he said, with a smile: “I did
speak yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yesterday!” she cried eagerly. “Yesterday, on Munkeggen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; all that now remains is to get Mr. Morgan’s consent
to our betrothal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Frithiof, I am so glad! so very glad! How pleased
father will be! I think you must write and let him know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If he will keep it quite secret,” said Frithiof; “but of
course not a word must be breathed until her father has consented.
There is no engagement as yet, only we know that we
love each other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That ought to be enough to satisfy you till the autumn.
And it was so nice of you to tell me, Frithiof. Oh, I don’t
think I could have borne it if you had chosen to marry some
girl I didn’t like. As for Blanche, there never was any one
more sweet and lovely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed that Frithiof’s happiness was to bring happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to the whole family. Even little Swanhild guessed the true
state of things, and began to frame visions of the happy future
when the beautiful English girl should become her own sister;
while as to Herr Falck, the news seemed to banish entirely the
heavy depression which for some time had preyed upon him.
And so, in spite of the waiting, the time slipped by quickly to
Frithiof, the mere thought of Blanche’s love kept him rapturously
happy, and at the pretty villa in Kalvedalen there was
much laughter and mirth, and music and singing—much eager
expectation and hope, and much planning of a future life
which should be even more full and happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length, when the afternoons closed in early, and the long
winter was beginning to give signs of its approach, Frithiof took
leave of his home, and, on one October Saturday, started on
his voyage to England. It was, in a sense, the great event of
his life, and they all instinctively knew that it was a crisis, so
that Sigrid drew aside little Swanhild at the last, and left the
father and son to have their parting words alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I look to you, Frithiof,” the father said eagerly, “I look
to you to carry out the aims in which I myself have failed—to
live the life I could wish to have lived. May God grant you
the wife who will best help you in the struggle! I sometimes
think, Frithiof, that things might have gone very differently
with me had your mother been spared.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you not let this depression influence you too much,
father?” said Frithiof. “Why take such a dark view of your
own life? I shall only be too happy if I make as much of the
world as you have done. I wish you could have come to England
too. I think you want change and rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” said Herr Falck, laughing, “once over there you will
not echo that wish. No, no, you are best by yourself when
you go a-wooing, my son. Besides, I could not possibly leave
home just now; we shall have the herring-fleet back from Iceland
before many days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as the signal was given that all friends of the passengers
must leave the steamer, he took Frithiof’s hand and held
it fast in his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless you, my boy—I think you will bring honor to
our name, sooner or later. Now, Sigrid, wish him well, and
let us be off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He called little Swanhild to him, and walked briskly down
the gangway, then stood on the quay, talking very cheerfully,
his momentary depression quite past. Before long the steamer
began to glide off, and Frithiof, even in the midst of his bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>expectations, felt a pang as he waved a farewell to those he
left behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A happy return to <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Gamle Norge</span></i>!” shouted Herr Falck.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Sigrid and Swanhild stood waving their handkerchiefs
till the steamer could no longer be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am a fool to mind going away!” reflected Frithiof. “In
three weeks’ time I shall be at home again. And the next
time I leave Bergen, why, who knows, perhaps it will be to attend
my own wedding!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And with that he began to pace the deck, whistling, as he
walked, “The Bridal Song of the Hardanger.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h2 id='V' class='c005'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The event to which we have long eagerly looked forward is
seldom all that we have expected, and Frithiof, who for the last
two months had been almost hourly rehearsing his arrival in
England, felt somewhat depressed and disillusioned when, one
chilly Monday morning, he first set foot on English soil. The
Southerner, arriving at Folkestone or Dover, with their white
cliffs and sunny aspect, gains a cheerful impression as he steps
ashore; but the Norwegian leaving behind him his mountains
and fjords, and coming straight to that most dingy and unattractive
town, Hull, is at great disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fine, drizzling rain was falling; in the early morning the
shabby, dirty houses looked their very worst. Swarms of grimy
little children had been turned out of their homes, and were making
their way to morning school, and hundreds of busy men and
women were hurrying through the streets, all with worn, anxious-looking
faces. As he walked to the railway station Frithiof felt
almost overpowered by the desolateness of the place. To be a
mere unit in this unthinking, unheeding crowd, to be pushed
and jostled by the hurrying passengers, who all walked as if
their very lives depended on their speed, to hear around him
the rapidly spoken foreign language, with its strange north-country
accent, all made him feel very keenly that he was indeed
a foreigner in a strange land. He was glad to be once
more in a familiar-looking train, and actually on his way to
London; and soon all these outer impressions faded away in
the absorbing consciousness that he was actually on his way to
Blanche—that on the very next day he might hope to see her
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately the Tuesday proved to be a lovely, still, autumn
day. He did not like to call upon Mr. Morgan till the afternoon,
and, indeed, thought that he should scarcely find him at
home earlier, so he roamed about London, and looked at his
watch about four times an hour, till at length the time came
when he could call a hansom and drive to Lancaster Gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some houses which the moment you enter them
suggest to you the idea of money. The Morgans’ house was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>one of these; everything was faultlessly arranged; your feet
sank into the softest of carpets, you were served by the most
obsequious of servants, all that was cheap or common or ordinary
was banished from view, and you felt that the chair you
sat on was a very superior chair, that all the pictures and ornaments
were the very best that could be bought, and that ordinary
people who could not boast of a very large income were
only admitted into this aggressively superior dwelling on sufferance.
With all its grandeur, it was not a house which tempted
you to break the tenth commandment; it inspired you with a
kind of wonder, and if the guests had truly spoken the thought
which most frequently occurred to them, it would have been:
“I wonder now what he gave for this? It must have cost a
perfect fortune!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As to Frithiof, when he was shown into the great empty
drawing-room with its luxurious couches and divans and its
wonderful collection of the very best upholstery and the most
telling works of art, he felt, as strongly as he had felt in the
dirty streets of Hull, that he was a stranger and a foreigner.
In the whole room there was nothing which suggested to him
the presence of Blanche; on the contrary, there was everything
which combated the vision of those days at Balholm and of
their sweet freedom. He felt stifled, and involuntarily crossed
the room and looked from the window at the green grass in
Kensington Gardens, and the tall elm-trees with their varying
autumn tints.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before many minutes had passed, however, his host came
into the room, greeting him politely but somewhat stiffly.
“Glad to make your acquaintance,” he said, scanning him a
little curiously as he spoke. “I heard of you, of course, from
my brother. I am sure they are all very much indebted to
you for planning their Norwegian tour for them so well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Had he also heard of him from Blanche? Had she indeed
prepared the way for him? Or would his request come as a
surprise? These were the thoughts which rushed through
Frithiof’s mind as he sat opposite the Englishman and noted his
regular features, short, neat-looking, gray beard, closely cropped
hair, and rather cold eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any one watching the two could scarcely have conceived a
greater contrast: the young Norwegian, eager, hopeful, bearing
in his face the look of one who has all the world before him;
the middle-aged Englishman who had bought his experience,
and in whose heart enthusiasm, and eager enjoyment of life,
and confident belief in those he encountered, had long ceased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to exist. Nevertheless, though Mr. Morgan was a hard-headed
and a somewhat cold-blooded man, he felt a little sorry for his
guest, and reflected to himself that such a fine looking fellow
was far more fit for the post at Stavanger than his own son
Cyril.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is curious that you should have come to-day,” he remarked,
after they had exchanged the usual platitudes about
the weather and the voyage and the first impressions of England.
“Only to-day the final decision was arrived at about this
long-mooted idea of the new branch of our firm at Stavanger.
Perhaps you have heard rumors of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have heard nothing at all,” said Frithiof. “My father
did not even mention it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is scarcely possible that he has heard nothing of the
idea,” said Mr. Morgan. “When I saw you I had thought he
had sent you over on that very account. However, you have
not as yet gone into the business, I understand?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am to be taken into partnership this autumn,” said
Frithiof. “I was of age the other day, and have only waited
for that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strange,” said Mr. Morgan, “that only this very morning
the telegram should have been sent to your father. Had I
known you were in England, I would have waited. One can
say things better face to face. And yet I don’t know how that
could have been either, for there was a sudden chance of getting
good promises at Stavanger, and delay was impossible. I
shall, of course, write fully to your father by the next mail,
and I will tell him that it is with great regret we sever our connection
with him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof was so staggered by this unexpected piece of news
that for a minute all else was driven from his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He will be very sorry to be no longer your agent,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I shall be sorry to lose him. Herr Falck has always
been most honorable. I have the greatest respect for him.
Still, business is business; one can’t afford to sentimentalize
in life over old connections. It is certainly best in the interest
of our firm to set up a branch of our own with its headquarters
at Stavanger. My son will go there very shortly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The telegram is only just sent, you say?” asked Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The first thing this morning,” replied Mr. Morgan. “It
was decided on last night. By this time your father knows all
about it; indeed, I almost wonder we have had no reply from
him. You must not let the affair make any breach between us;
it is after all, a mere business necessity. I must find out from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Mrs. Morgan what free nights we have, and you must come and
dine with us. I will write and let you know. Have you any
particular business in London? or have you only come for the
sake of traveling?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I came to see you, sir,” said Frithiof, his heart beating quickly,
though he spoke with his usual directness. “I came to ask
your consent to my betrothal with your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With my daughter!” exclaimed Mr. Morgan. “Betrothal!
What, in Heaven’s name, can you be thinking of?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not, of course, mean that there was a definite engagement
between us,” said Frithiof, speaking all the more steadily
because of this repulse. “Of course we could not have thought
of that until we had asked your consent. We agreed that I
should come over this autumn and speak to you about it; nothing
passed at Balholm but just the assurance that we loved each
other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Loved each other!” ejaculated Mr. Morgan, beginning to
pace the room with a look of perplexity and annoyance.
“What folly will the girl commit next?”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this Frithiof also rose to his feet, the angry color rising
to his face. “I should never have spoken of my love to
your daughter had I not been in a position to support her,”
he said hotly. “By your English standards I may not, perhaps,
be very rich, but our firm is one of the leading firms in
Bergen. We come of a good old Norwegian family. Why
should it be a folly for your daughter to love me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You misunderstand me,” said Mr. Morgan. “I don’t wish
to say one word against yourself. However, as you have alluded
to the matter I must tell you plainly that I expect my
daughter to make a very different marriage. Money I can provide
her with. Her husband will supply her with a title.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” cried Frithiof furiously, “you will force her to
marry some wretched aristocrat whom she can’t possibly love?
For the sake of a mere title you ruin her happiness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall certainly do nothing of the kind,” said the Englishman,
with a touch of dignity. “Sit down, Herr Falck, and
listen to me. I would have spared you this had it been possible.
You are very young, and you have taken things for
granted too much. You believed that the first pretty girl that
flirted with you was your future wife. I can quite fancy that
Blanche was well pleased to have you dancing attendance on
her in Norway, but it was on her part nothing but a flirtation,
she does not care for you in the least.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not believe it,” said Frithiof hotly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Don’t think that I wish to excuse her,” said Mr. Morgan.
“She is very much to be blamed. But, she is pretty and winsome,
she knows her own power, and it pleases her to use it;
women are all of them vain and selfish. What do they care
for the suffering they cause?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall not say such things of her,” cried Frithiof desperately.
“It is not true. It can’t be true!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His face had grown deathly pale, and he was trembling with
excitement. Mr. Morgan felt sorry for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My poor fellow,” he said kindly, “don’t take it so hard.
You are not the first man who has been deceived. I am heartily
sorry that my child’s foolish thoughtlessness should have
given you this to bear. But, after all, it’s a lesson every one
has to learn; you were inexperienced and young.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not possible!” repeated Frithiof in terrible agitation,
remembering vividly her promises, her words of love, her
kisses, the expression of her eyes, as she had yielded to his
eager declaration of love. “I will never believe it possible till
I hear it from her own lips.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With a gesture of annoyance, Mr. Morgan crossed the room
and rang the bell. “Well, let it be so, then,” he said coldly.
“Blanche has treated you ill; I don’t doubt it for a moment,
and you will have every right to hear the explanation from
herself.” Then, as the servant appeared, “Tell Miss Morgan
that I want her in the drawing-room. Desire her to come at
once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The minutes of waiting which followed were the worst
Frithiof had ever lived through. Doubt, fear, indignation,
and passionate love strove together in his heart, while mingled
with all was the oppressive consciousness of his host’s presence,
and of the aggressive superiority of the room and its contents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the waiting was not altogether pleasant to Mr. Morgan;
he poked the fire and moved about restlessly. When, at
last, light footsteps were heard on the stairs, and Blanche entered
the room, he turned toward her with evident displeasure
in his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>She wore a dress of reddish brown with a great deal of plush
about it, and something in the way it was made suggested the
greatest possible contrast to the little simple traveling-dress she
had worn in Norway. Her eyes were bright and eager, her
loveliness as great as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You wanted me, papa?” she began; then, as she came forward
and recognized Frithiof, she gave a little start of dismay
and the color burned in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Yes, I wanted you,” said Mr. Morgan gravely. “Herr
Falck’s son has just arrived.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She struggled hard to recover herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am very glad to see you again,” she said, forcing up a
little artificial laugh and holding out her hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frithiof had seen her first expression of dismay and it
had turned him into ice; he would not take her proffered
hand, but only bowed formally. There was a painful silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is not the first time, Blanche, that you have learned
what comes of playing with edged tools,” said Mr. Morgan
sternly. “I heard from others that you had flirted with Herr
Falck’s son in Norway; I now learn that it was by your own
suggestion that he came to England to ask my consent to an
engagement, and that you allowed him to believe that you
loved him. What have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c000'>While her father spoke, Blanche had stood by with bent
head and downcast eyes; at this direct question she looked up
for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought I did care for him just at the time,” she faltered.
“It—it was a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, then, did you not write and tell him so? It was the
least you could have done,” said her father.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was such a difficult letter to write,” she faltered. “I
kept on putting it off, and hoping that he, too, would find out
his mistake. And then sometimes I thought I could explain it
all better to him if he came.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof made a step or two forward; his face was pale and
rigid; the blue seemed to have died out of his eyes—they
looked like steel. “I wait for your explanation,” he said, in a
voice which, in spite of its firmness, betrayed intense agitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Morgan without a word quitted the room, and the two
were left alone. Again there was a long, expressive silence.
Then, with a sob, Blanche turned away, sinking down on an
ottoman and covering her face with her hands. Her tears instantly
melted Frithiof; his indignation and wounded pride gave
pace to love and tenderness; a sort of wild hope rose in his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blanche! Blanche!” he cried. “It isn’t true! It can’t
be all over! Others have been urging you to make some grand
marriage—to be the wife perhaps of some rich nobleman. But
he can not love you as I love you. Oh! have you forgotten
how you told me I might trust to you? There is not a moment
since then that you have not been in my thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hoped so you would forget,” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How could I forget? What man could help remembering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>you day and night? Oh, Blanche, don’t you understand that
I love you? I love you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I understand only too well,” she said, glancing at him, her
dark eyes brimming over with tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew nearer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you will love me once more,” he said passionately.
“You will not choose rank and wealth; you will—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, hush! hush!” she cried. “It has all been a dreadful
mistake. I never really loved you. Oh, don’t look like that!
I was very dull in Norway—there was no one else but you. I
am sorry; very sorry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He started back from her as if she had dealt him some mortal
blow, but Blanche went on, speaking quickly and incoherently,
never looking in his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After we went away I began to see all the difficulties so
plainly—our belonging to different countries, and being accustomed
to different things; but still I did really think I liked
you till we got to Christiania. There, on the steamer coming
home, I found that it had all been a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She paused. All this time she had carefully kept the fingers
of her left hand out of view; the position was too constrained
not to attract Frithiof’s notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remembered that, in the wearing of betrothal or wedding-rings,
English custom reversed the Norwegian, and turned
upon her almost fiercely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you try to hide that from me?” he cried. “Are
you already betrothed to this other man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was only last Sunday,” she sobbed. “And I meant to
write to you; I did indeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more she covered her face with her hands, this time
not attempting to hide from Frithiof the beautiful circlet of
brilliants on her third finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to him that giant hands seized on him then and
crushed out of him his very life. Yet the pain of living went
on remorselessly, and as if from a very great distance he heard
Blanche’s voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am engaged to Lord Romiaux,” she said. “He had
been in Norway on a fishing tour, but it was on the steamer
that we first met. And then almost directly I knew that at
Munkeggen it had all been quite a mistake, and that I had
never really loved you. We met again at one of the watering-places
in September, but it was only settled the day before yesterday.
I wish—oh, how I wish—that I had written to tell
you!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>She stood up impulsively and drew nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there nothing I can do to make up for my mistake?”
she said, lifting pathetic eyes to his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing.” he said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, don’t think badly of me for it,” she pleaded. “Don’t
hate me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hate you?” he exclaimed. “It will be the curse of my
life that I love you—that you have made me love you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned as though to go away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t go without saying good-by,” she exclaimed; and
her eyes said more plainly than words, “I do not mind if you
kiss me just once more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused, ice one minute, fire the next, yet through it all
aware that his conscience was urging him to go without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blanche watched him tremulously; she drew yet nearer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could we not still be friends?” she said, with a pathetic
little quiver in her voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he cried vehemently, yet with a certain dignity in
his manner; “no, we could not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, before Blanche could recover enough from her sense
of humiliation at this rebuff to speak, he bowed to her and left
the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>She threw herself down on the sofa and buried her face in
the cushions. “Oh, what must he think of me? what must he
think of me?” she sobbed. “How I wish I had written to
him at once and saved myself this dreadful scene! How
could I have been so silly! so dreadfully silly! To be afraid
of writing a few words in a letter! My poor Viking! he
looked so grand as he turned away. I wish we could have
been friends still; it used to be so pleasant in Norway; he was
so unlike other people; he interested me. And now it is all
over, and I shall never be able to meet him again. Oh, I have
managed very badly. If I had not been so imprudent on
Munkeggen he might have been my cavalier all his life, and I
should have liked to show him over here to people. I should
have liked to initiate him in everything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The clock on the mantel-piece struck five. She started up
and ran across to one of the mirrors, looking anxiously at her
eyes. “Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do?” she thought.
“Algernon will be here directly, and I have made a perfect
object of myself with crying.” Then, as the door-bell rang,
she caught up a couvrette, sunk down on the sofa, and covered
herself up picturesquely. “There is nothing for it but a
bad headache,” she said to herself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>On the stairs Frithiof was waylaid by Mr. Morgan; it was
with a sort of surprise that he heard his own calm replies to
the Englishman’s polite speeches, and regrets, and inquiries as
to when he returned to Norway, for all the time his head was
swimming, and it was astonishing that he could frame a correct
English phrase. The thought occurred to him that Mr. Morgan
would be glad enough to get rid of him and to put an end
to so uncomfortable a visit; he could well imagine the shrug
of relief with which the Englishman would return to his fireside,
with its aggressively grand fenders and fire-irons, and
would say to himself, “Well, poor devil, I am glad he is gone!
A most provoking business from first to last.” For to the
Morgans the affair would probably end as soon as the door had
closed behind him, but for himself it would drag on and on
indefinitely. He walked on mechanically past the great houses
which, to his unaccustomed eyes, looked so palatial; every little
trivial thing seemed to obtrude itself upon him; he noticed
the wan, haggard-looking crossing sweeper, who tried his best
to find something to sweep on that dry, still day when even
autumn leaves seldom fell; he noticed the pretty spire of the
church, and heard the clock strike five, reflecting that one brief
half-hour had been enough to change his whole life—to bring
him from the highest point of hope and eager anticipation to
this lowest depth of wretchedness. The endless succession of
great, monotonous houses grew intolerable to him; he crossed
the road and turned into Kensington Gardens, aware, as the
first wild excitement died down in his heart, of a cold, desolate
blankness, the misery of which appalled him. What was
the meaning of it all? How could it possibly be borne? Only
by degrees did it dawn upon his overwrought brain that
Blanche’s faithlessness had robbed him of much more than her
love. It had left him stripped and wounded on the highway
of life; it had taken from him all belief in woman; it had
made forever impossible for him his old creed of the joy of
mere existence; it had killed his youth. Was he now to get
up, and crawl on, and drag through the rest of his life as best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>might be? Why, what was life worth to him now? He had
been a fool ever to believe in it; it was as she herself had once
told him, he had believed that it was all-sufficient merely because
he had never known unhappiness—never known the agony
that follows when, for—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“The first time Nature says plain ‘No’</div>
      <div class='line'>To some ‘Yes’ in you, and walks over you</div>
      <div class='line'>In gorgeous sweeps of scorn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His heart was so utterly dead that he could not even think
of his home; neither his father nor Sigrid rose before him as
he looked down that long, dreary vista of life that lay beyond.
He could only see that Blanche was no longer his; that the
Blanche he had loved and believed in had never really existed;
that he had been utterly deceived, cheated, defrauded; and
that something had been taken from him which could never
return.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will not live a day longer,” he said to himself; “not an
hour longer.” And in the relief of having some attainable
thing to desire ardently, were it only death and annihilation,
he quickened his pace and felt a sort of renewal of energy and
life within him, urging him on, holding before him the one aim
which he thought was worth pursuing. He would end it all
quickly, he would not linger on, weakly bemoaning his fate, or
railing at life for having failed him and disappointed his hopes;
he would just put an end to everything without more ado. As
to arguing with himself about the right or wrong of the matter,
such a notion never occurred to him, he just walked blindly
on, certain that some opportunity would present itself, buoyed
up by an unreasoning hope that death would bring him
relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time he had reached Hyde Park, and a vague memory
came back to him; he remembered that, as he drove to
Lancaster Gate, that afternoon, he had crossed a bridge.
There was water over there. It should be that way. And he
walked on more rapidly than before, still with an almost dazzling
perception of all the trifling little details, the color of the
dry, dusty road, the green of the turf, the dresses of those who
passed by him, the sound of their voices, the strange incongruity
of their perfectly unconcerned, contented faces. He
would get away from all this—would wait till it was dusk, when
he could steal down unnoticed to the water. Buoyed up by
this last hope of relief, he walked along the north shore of the
Serpentine, passed the Receiving House of the Royal Humane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Society, with an unconcerned thought that his lifeless body
would probably be taken there, passed the boat-house with a
fervent hope that no one there would try a rescue, and at
length, finding a seat under a tree close to the water’s edge, sat
down to wait for the darkness. It need not be for long, for
already the sun was setting, and over toward the west he could
see that behind the glowing orange and russet of the autumn
trees was a background of crimson sky. The pretty little
wooded island and the round green boat-house on the shore
stood out in strong relief; swans and ducks swam about contentedly;
on the further bank was a dark fringe of trees; away
to the left the three arches of a gray-stone bridge. In the evening
light it made a fair picture, but the beauty of it seemed only
to harden him, for it reminded him of past happiness; he
turned with sore-hearted relief to the nearer view of the Serpentine
gleaming coldly as its waters washed the shore, and to
the dull monotony of the path in front of him with its heaps of
brown leaves. A bird sat singing in the beech-tree above him;
its song jarred on him just as much as the beauty of the sunset,
it seemed to urge him to leave the place where he was not
needed, to take himself out of a world which was meant for
beauty and brightness and success, a world which had no sympathy
for failure or misery. He longed for the song to cease,
and he longed for the sunset glory to fade, he was impatient
for the end; the mere waiting for that brief interval became to
him almost intolerable; only the dread of being rescued held
him back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently footsteps on the path made him look up; a shabbily
dressed girl walked slowly by, she was absorbed in a newspaper
story and did not notice him; neither did she notice her
charge, a pale-faced, dark-eyed little girl of about six years old
who followed her at some distance, chanting a pretty, monotonous
little tune as she dragged a toy-cart along the gravel.
Frithiof, with the preternatural powers of observation which
seemed his that day, noticed in an instant every tiniest detail
of the child’s face and dress and bearing, the curious anatomy
of the wooden horse, the heap of golden leaves in the little
cart. As the child drew nearer, the words of the song became
perfectly audible to him. She sang very slowly, and in a sort
of unconscious way, as if she couldn’t help it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Comfort every sufferer,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Watching late in pain—”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>She paused to put another handful of leaves into the cart, arranged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>them with great care, patted the wooden steed, and resumed
her song as if there had been no interruption—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Those who plan some evil,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>From their sin restrain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof felt as if a knife had been suddenly plunged into
him; he tried to hear more, but the words died away, he could
only follow the monotonous little tune in the clear voice, and
the rattling of the toy cart on the pathway. And so the child
passed on out of sight, and he saw her no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was alone again, and the twilight for which he had
longed was fast closing in upon him; a sort of blue haze
seemed gathering over the park; night was coming on. What
was this horrible new struggle which was beginning within him?
“Evil,” “sin”; could he not at least do what he would with his
own life? Where was the harm in ending that which was
hopelessly spoiled and ruined? Was not suicide a perfectly
legitimate ending to a life?</p>

<p class='c000'>A voice within him answered his question plainly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“To the man with a diseased brain—the man who doesn’t
know what he is about—it is no worse an end than to die in
bed of a fever. But to you—you who are afraid of the suffering
of life, you who know quite well what you are doing—to
you it is sin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fight against it as he would, he could not stifle this new consciousness
which had arisen within him. What had led him,
he angrily wondered, to choose that particular place to wait in?
What had made that child walk past? What had induced her
to sing those particular words? Did that vague First Cause,
in whom after a fashion he believed, take any heed of trifles
such as those? He would never believe that. Only women
or children could hold such a creed: only those who led
sheltered, innocent, ignorant lives. But a man—a man who
had just learned what the world really was, who saw that the
weakest went to the wall, and might triumphed over right—a
man who had once believed in the beauty of life and had been
bitterly disillusioned—could never believe in a God who ordered
all things for good. It was a chance, a mere unlucky
chance, yet the child’s words had made it impossible for him
to die in peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a matter of fact the sunset sky and fading light had
suggested to the little one’s untroubled mind the familiar evening
hymn with its graphic description of scenery, its beautiful
word-painting, its wide human sympathies; and that great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>mystery of life which links us together, whether we know it or
not, gave to the child the power to counteract the influence of
Blanche Morgan’s faithlessness, and to appeal to one to whom
the sight of that same sunset had suggested only thoughts of
despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild confusion of memories seemed to rush through his
mind, and blended with them always were the welcome words
and the quiet little chant. He was back at home again talking
with the old pastor who had prepared him for confirmation; he
was a mere boy once more, unhesitatingly accepting all that he
was taught; he was standing in the great crowded Bergen
church and declaring his belief in Christ, and his entire willingness
to give up everything wrong; he was climbing a mountain
with Blanche and arguing with her that life—mere existence—was
beautiful and desirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking back afterward on the frightful struggle, it seemed
to him that for ages he had tossed to and fro in that horrible
hesitation. In reality all must have been over within a quarter
of an hour. There rose before him the recollection of his
father as he had last seen him standing on the deck of the
steamer, and he remembered the tone of his voice as he had
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I look to you, Frithiof, to carry out the aims in which I
myself have failed, to live the life that I could wish to have
lived.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw once again the wistful look in his father’s eyes, the
mingled love, pride, and anxiety with which he had turned to
him, loath to let him go, and yet eager to speed him on his
way. Should he now disappoint all his hopes? Should he,
deliberately and in the full possession of all his faculties, take
a step which must bring terrible suffering to his home people?
And then he remembered for the first time that already trouble
and vexation and loss had overtaken his father; he knew well
how greatly he would regret the connection with the English
firm, and he pictured to himself the familiar house in Kalvedalen
with a new and unfamiliar cloud upon it, till instead of
the longing for death there came to him a nobler longing—a
longing to go back and help, a longing to make up to his father
for the loss and vexation and the slight which had been put
upon him. He began to feel ashamed of the other wish, he
began to realize that there was still something to be lived for,
though indeed life looked to him as dim and uninviting as the
twilight park with its wreaths of gray mists, and its unpeopled
solitude.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Yet still he would live; the other thought no longer allured
him, his strength and manliness were returning; with bitter
resolution he tore himself from the vision of Blanche which
rose mockingly before him, and getting up, made his way out
of the park.</p>

<p class='c000'>Emerging once more into the busy world of traffic at Hyde
Park corner, the perception of his forlorn desolateness came to
him with far more force than in the quiet path by the Serpentine.
For the first time he felt keenly that he was in an unknown
city, and there came over him a sick longing for Norway,
for dear old Bergen, for the familiar mountains, the familiar
faces, the friendly greetings of passers-by. For a few minutes
he stood still, uncertain which road to take, wondering
how in the world he should get through the weary hours of his
solitary evening. Close by him a young man stood talking to
the occupants of a brougham which had drawn up by the pavement;
he heard a word or two of their talk, dimly, almost
unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is the result of the trial known yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, five years’ penal servitude, and no more than he
deserves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The poor children! what will become of them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall you be home by ten? We wont hinder you, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite by ten. Tell father that Sardoni is free for the
night he wanted him; I met him just now. Good-by.”
Then to the coachman “Home!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The word startled Frithiof back to the recollection of his
own affairs; he had utterly lost his bearings and must ask for
direction. He would accost this man who seemed a little less
in a hurry than the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you kindly tell me the way to the Arundel Hotel?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man turned at the sound of his voice, looked
keenly at him for an instant, then held out his hand in cordial
welcome.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How are you?” he exclaimed. “What a lucky chance that
we should have run across each other in the dark like this!
Have you been long in England?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof, at the first word of hearty greeting, looked up with
startled eyes, and in the dim gas-light he saw the honest English
face and kindly eyes of Roy Boniface.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Meantime the brougham had bowled swiftly away and its
two occupants had settled themselves down comfortably as
though they were preparing for a long drive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you warm enough, my child? Better let me have this
window down, and you put yours up,” said Mrs. Boniface,
glancing with motherly anxiety at the fair face beside her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You spoil me, mother dear,” said Cecil. “And indeed I
do want you not to worry about me. I am quite strong, if you
would only believe it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, well, I hope you are,” said Mrs. Boniface, with a
sigh. “But any way it’s more than you look, child.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the mother thought wistfully of two graves in a distant
cemetery where Cecil’s sisters lay; and she remembered with
a cruel pang that only a few days ago some friend had remarked
to her, with the thoughtless frankness of a rapid talker, “Cecil
is looking so pretty just now, but she’s got the consumptive
look in her face, don’t you think?” And these words lay
rankling in the poor mother’s heart, even though she had been
assured by the doctors that there was no disease, no great delicacy
even, no cause whatever for anxiety.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad we have seen Doctor Royston,” said Cecil,
“because now we shall feel quite comfortable, and you wont
be anxious any more, mother. It would be dreadful, I think,
to have to be a sort of semi-invalid all one’s life, though I suppose
some people just enjoy it, since Doctor Royston said that
half the girls in London were invalided just for want of sensible
work. I rather believe, mother, that is what has been
the matter with me,” and she laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You, my dear!” said Mrs. Boniface; “I am sure you are
not at all idle at home. No one could say such a thing of
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I am always having to invent things to do to keep myself
busy,” said Cecil. “Mother, I have got a plan in my
head now that would settle my work for five whole years, and
I do so want you to say ‘yes’ to it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It isn’t that you want to go into some sisterhood?” asked
Mrs. Boniface, her gentle gray eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Oh, no, no,” said Cecil emphatically. “Why, how could I
ever go away from home and leave you, darling, just as I am
getting old enough to be of use to you? It’s nothing of that
kind, and the worst of it is that it would mean a good deal of
expense to father, which seems hardly fair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He wont grudge that,” said Mrs. Boniface. “Your father
would do anything to please you, dear. What is this plan?
Let me hear about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, the other night when I was hearing all about those
poor Grantleys opposite to us—how the mother had left her
husband and children and gone off no one knows where, and
then how the father had forged that check and would certainly
be imprisoned; I began to wonder what sort of a chance the
children had in the world. And no one seemed to know or to
care what would become of them, except father, and he said
we must try to get them into some asylum or school.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It isn’t many asylums that would care to take them, I expect,”
said Mrs. Boniface. “Poor little things, there’s a hard
fight before them! But what was your plan?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, mother, it was just to persuade father to let them
come to us for the five years. Of course it would be an expense
to him, but I would teach them, and help to take care of them;
and oh, it would be so nice to have children about the house!
One can never be dull where there are children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew she was dull at home,” thought the mother to herself.
“It was too much of a change for her to come back from
school, from so many educated people and young friends, to
an ignorant old woman like me and a silent house. Not that
the child would ever allow it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But of course, darling,” said Cecil, “I wont say a word
more about it if you think it would trouble you or make the
house too noisy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is plenty of room for them, poor little mites,” said
Mrs. Boniface. “And the plan is just like you, dear. There’s
only one objection I have to it. I don’t like your binding yourself
to work for so many years—not just now while you are so
young. I should have liked you to marry, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I don’t think that is likely,” said Cecil. “And it does
seem so stupid to let the time pass on, and do nothing for years
and years just because there is a chance that some man whom
you could accept may propose to you. The chances are quite
equal that it may not be so, and then you have wasted a great
part of your life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you could have fancied Herbert White,” said Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Boniface wistfully. “He would have made such a good husband.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope he will to some one else. But that would have been
impossible, mother, quite, quite impossible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cecil, dearie, is there—is there any one else?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No one, mother,” said Cecil quietly, and the color in her
cheeks did not deepen, and Mrs. Boniface felt satisfied. Yet,
nevertheless, at that very moment there flashed into Cecil’s
mind the perception of the real reason which had made it impossible
for her to accept the offer of marriage that a week or
two ago she had refused. She saw that Frithiof Falck would
always be to her a sort of standard by which to measure the
rest of mankind, and she faced the thought quietly, for there
never had been any question of love between them; he would
probably marry the pretty Miss Morgan, and it was very unlikely
that she should ever meet him again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man whom I could accept must be that sort of man,”
she thought to herself. “And there is something degrading in
the idea of standing and waiting for the doubtful chance that
such a one may some day appear. Surely we girls were not
born into the world just to stand in rows waiting to get married?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I am sure I don’t know what I should do without you
if you did get married,” said Mrs. Boniface, driving back the
tears which had started to her eyes, “so I don’t know why I
am so anxious that it should come about, except that I should
so like to see you happy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so I am happy, perfectly happy,” said Cecil, and as
she spoke she suddenly bent forward and kissed her mother.
“A girl would have to be very wicked not to be happy with
you and father and Roy to live with.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you were not cut off from so much,” said Mrs. Boniface.
“You see, dear, if you were alone in the world people
would take you up—I mean the style of people you would care
to be friends with—but as long as there’s the shop, and as long
as you have a mother who can’t talk well about recent books,
and who is not always sure how to pronounce things—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother! mother!” cried Cecil, “how can you say such
things? As long as I have you, what do I want with any one
else?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Boniface patted the girl’s hand tenderly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I like to talk of the books with you, dearie,” she said;
“you understand that. There’s nothing pleases me better than
to hear you read of an evening, and I’m very much interested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>in that poor Mrs. Carlyle, though it does seem to me it’s a
comfort to be in private life, where no biographers can come
raking up all your foolish words and bits of quarrels after you
are dead and buried. Why, here we are at home. How quick
we have got down this evening! As to your plan, dearie, I’ll
just talk it over with father the very first chance I have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, mother. I do so hope he will let us have
them.” And Cecil sprang out of the carriage with more animation
in her face than Mrs. Boniface had seen there for a
long time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Boniface was a Devonshire woman, and, notwithstanding
her five-and-twenty years of London life, she still preserved
something of her western accent and intonation; she had also
the gentle manner and the quiet consideration and courtesy
which seem innate in most west-country people. As to education,
she had received the best that was to be had for tradesmen’s
daughters in the days of her youth, but she was well
aware that it did not come up to modern requirements, and
had taken good care that Cecil should be brought up very
differently. There was something very attractive in her homely
simplicity; and though she could not help regretting that
Cecil, owing to her position, was cut off from much that other
girls enjoyed, nothing would have induced her to try to push
her way in the world,—she was too true a lady for that, and,
moreover, beneath all her gentleness had too much dignity and
independence of character. So it had come to pass that they
lived a very quiet life, with few intimate friends and not too
many acquaintances; but perhaps they were none the less happy
for that. Certainly there was about the home a sense of peace
and rest not too often to be met with in this bustling nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c000'>The opportunity for suggesting Cecil’s plan to Mr. Boniface
came soon after they reached home. In that house things were
wont to be quickly settled; they were not great at discussions,
and perhaps this accounted in a great measure for the peace of
the domestic atmosphere. Certainly there is nothing so productive
of family quarrels as the habit of perpetually talking
over the various arrangements, household or personal, and
many a good digestion must have been ruined, and many a
temper soured by the baneful habit of arguing the <em>pros</em> and
<em>cons</em> of some vexed question during breakfast or dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil was in the drawing-room, playing one of Chopin’s
Ballads, when her father came into the room. He stood by
the fire till she had finished, watching her thoughtfully. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>was an elderly man, tall and spare, with a small, shapely head,
white hair and trim white beard. His gray eyes were honest
and kindly, like his son’s, and the face was a good as well as a
refined face. He was one of the deacons of a Congregational
chapel, and came of an old Nonconformist family, which for
many generations had pleaded and suffered for religious liberty.
Robert Boniface was true to his principles, and when his children
grew up, and, becoming old enough to go thoroughly into
the question, declared their wish to join the Church of England,
he made not the slightest objection. What was more, he
would not even allow them to see that it was a grief to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not to be supposed that every one should see from one
point of view,” he had said to his wife. “We are all of us
looking to the same sun, and that is the great thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such division must always be a little sad, but mutual love
and mutual respect made them in this case a positive gain.
There were no arguments, but each learned to see and admire
what was good in the other’s view, to hold stanchly to what was
deemed right, and to live in that love which practically nullifies
all petty divisions and differences.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so I hear that you want to be mothering those little
children over the way,” said Mr. Boniface, when the piece was
ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil crossed the room and stood beside him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think about it, father?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think that before you decide you must realize that it will
be a great responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have thought of that,” she said. “And of course there
is the expense to be thought of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind about the expense; I will undertake that part
of the matter if you will undertake the responsibility. Do you
quite realize that even pretty little children are sometimes cross
and naughty and ill?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes; I have seen those children in all aspects, and
they are rather spoiled. But I can’t bear to think that they
will be sent to some great institution, with no one to care for
them properly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you are willing to undertake your share of the bargain?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, then, that is settled. Let us come across and
see if any one has stepped in before us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil, in great excitement, flew upstairs to tell her mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and reappeared in a minute or two in her hat and jacket.
Then the father and daughter crossed the quiet suburban road
to the opposite house, where such a different life-story had been
lived. The door was opened to them by the nurse; she
had evidently been crying, and even as they entered the passage
they seemed conscious of the desolation of the whole
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, miss, have you heard the verdict?” said the servant,
who knew Cecil slightly, and was eager for sympathy. “And
what’s to become of my little ones no one seems to know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is just what we came to inquire about,” said Mr.
Boniface, “We heard there were no relations to take charge
of them. Is that true?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s not a creature in the world to care for them, sir,”
said the nurse. “There’s the lawyer looking through master’s
papers now, sir, and he says we must be out of this by next
week, and that he must look up some sort of school where they’ll
take them cheap. A school for them little bits of things, sir,
isn’t it enough to break one’s heart? And little Miss Gwen
so delicate, and only a lawyer to choose it, one as knows nothing
but about parchments and red tape, sir, and hasn’t so much
as handled a child in his life, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If Mr. Grantley’s solicitor is here I should like to speak
to him for a minute,” said Mr. Boniface. “I’ll be with you
again before long, Cecil; perhaps you could see the children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was shown into the study which had belonged to the
master of the house, and unfolded Cecil’s suggestion to the
lawyer, who proved to be a much more fatherly sort of man
than the nurse had represented. He was quite certain that
his client would be only too grateful for so friendly an act.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Things have gone hardly with poor Grantley,” he remarked.
“And such an offer will be the greatest possible
surprise to him. The poor fellow has not had a fair chance;
handicapped with such a wife, one can almost forgive him for
going to the bad. I shall be seeing him once more to-morrow,
and will let you know what he says. But of course there can
be but one answer—he will thankfully accept your help.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Cecil had been taken upstairs to the nursery; it
looked a trifle less desolate than the rest of the house, yet lying
on the table among the children’s toys she saw an evening
paper with the account of the verdict and sentence on John
Grantley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nurse had gone into the adjoining room, but she quickly
returned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“They are asleep, miss, but you’ll come in and see them,
wont you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil had wished for this, and followed her guide into the
dimly lighted night nursery, where in two little cribs lay her
future charges. They were beautiful children, and as she
watched them in their untroubled sleep and thought of the
mother who had deserted them and disgraced her name, and
the father who was that moment beginning his five years of
penal servitude, her heart ached for the little ones, and more
and more she longed to help them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lancelot, the elder of the two, was just four years old; he
had a sweet, rosy, determined little face with a slightly Jewish
look about it, his curly brown hair was long enough to fall
back over the pillow, and in his fat little hand he grasped a toy
horse, which was his inseparable companion night and day.
The little girl was much smaller and much more fragile-looking,
though in some respects the two were alike. Her baby face
looked exquisite now in its perfect peace, and Cecil did not
wonder that the nurse’s tears broke forth again as she spoke
of the little two-year-old Gwen being sent to school. They
were still talking about the matter when Mr. Boniface rejoined
them; the lawyer also came in, and, to the nurse’s
surprise, even looked at the sleeping children. “Quite human-like,”
as she remarked afterward to the cook.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you distress yourself about the children,” he said
kindly. “It will be all right for them. Probably they will only
have to move across the road. We shall know definitely
about it to-morrow; but this gentleman has very generously
offered to take care of them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The nurse’s tearful gratitude was interrupted by a sound
from one of the cribs. Lance, disturbed perhaps by the voices,
was talking in his sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gee-up,” he shouted, in exact imitation of a carter, as he
waved the toy-horse in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one laughed, and took the hint: the lawyer went back
to his work, and Mr. Boniface and Cecil, after a few parting
words with the happy servant, recrossed the road to Rowan
Tree House.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, father, it is so very good of you,” said Cecil, slipping
her arm into his; “I haven’t been so happy for an age!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I am happy,” he replied, “that it is such a thing as
this which pleases my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After that there followed a delightful evening of anticipation,
and Mrs. Boniface entered into the plan with her whole heart and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>talked of nursery furniture put away in the loft, and arranged
the new nursery in imagination fifty times over—always with
improvements. And this made them talk of the past, and she
began to tell amusing stories of Roy and Cecil when they were
children, and even went back to remembrances of her own
nursery life, in which a stern nurse who administered medicine
with a forcing spoon figured largely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe,” said the gentle old lady, laughing, “that it was
due to that old nurse of mine that I never could bear theological
arguments. She began them when we were so young that we
took a fatal dislike to them. I can well remember, as a little
thing of four years old, sitting on the punishment chair in the
nursery when all the others were out at play, and wishing that
Adam and Eve hadn’t sinned.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You all sound very merry,” said Roy, opening the door
before the laugh which greeted this story had died away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, how nice and early you are, Roy!” exclaimed Cecil.
“Oh! mother has been telling us no end of stories, you ought
to have been here to listen to them. And, Roy, we are most
likely going to have those little children over the way to live
with us till their father is out of prison again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy seemed grave and preoccupied, but Cecil was too happy
to notice that, and chattered on contentedly. He scarcely
heard her, yet a sense of strong contrast made the home-likeness
of the scene specially emphasized to him. He looked at
his father leaning back in the great arm-chair, with reading-lamp
and papers close by him, but with his eyes fixed on Cecil
as she sat on the rug at his feet, the firelight brightening her
fair hair; he looked at his mother on the opposite side of the
hearth, in the familiar dress which she almost always wore—black
silk with soft white lace about the neck and bodice, and
a pretty white lace cap. She was busy with her netting, but
every now and then glanced up at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are tired to-night, Roy,” she said, when Cecil’s story
had come to an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just a little,” he owned. “Such a curious thing happened
to me. It was a good thing you caught sight of me at Hyde
Park Corner and stopped to ask about the trial, Cecil, for otherwise
it would never have come about. Who do you think I
met just as you drove on?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t guess,” said Cecil, rising from her place on the
hearth-rug as the gong sounded for supper.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of our Norwegian friends,” said Roy. “Frithiof
Falck.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“What! is he actually in England?” said Cecil, taking up
the reading-lamp to carry it into the next room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, poor fellow,” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in his tone made Cecil’s heart beat quickly; she
could not have accounted for the strength of the feeling which
suddenly overwhelmed her; she hardly knew what it was she
feared so much, or why such a sudden panic had seized upon
her; she trembled from head to foot, and was glad as they
crossed the hall to hand the lamp to Roy, glancing up at him as
she did so, apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you say poor fellow?” she asked. “Oh, Roy,
what is the matter? what—what has happened to him?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='VIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“The house seems quiet without Frithiof,” remarked Herr
Falck on the Monday after his son’s departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof at that very moment was walking through the streets
of Hull, feeling lonely and desolate enough. They felt desolate
without him at Bergen, and began to talk much of his
return, and to wonder when the wedding would be, and to
settle what presents they would give Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dining-room looked very pleasant on that October
morning. Sigrid, though never quite happy when her twin
was away, was looking forward eagerly to his return, and was
so much cheered by the improvement in her father’s health and
spirits that she felt more at rest than she had done for some
time. Little Swanhild, whose passion for Blanche increased
daily, was in the seventh heaven of happiness, and though she
had not been told everything, knew quite well that the general
expectation was that Frithiof would be betrothed to her ideal.
As for Herr Falck he looked eager and hopeful, and it seemed
as if some cloud of care had been lifted off him. He talked
more than he had done of late, teased Swanhild merrily about
her lessons, and kept both girls laughing and chattering at the
table till Swanhild had to run off in a hurry, declaring that she
should be late for school.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You should not tell such funny stories in the morning,
little father!” she said laughingly, as she stopped for the customary
kiss and “<i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">tak for maden</span></i>” (thanks for the meal) on her
way out of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but to laugh is so good for the digestion,” said Herr
Falck. “You will read English all the better in consequence.
See if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you busy to-day, father?” asked Sigrid, as the door
closed behind the little girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not at all. I shall take a walk before going to the office.
I tell you what, Sigrid, you shall come with me and get a new
English story at Beyer’s, to cheer you in Frithiof’s absence.
What was the novel some one told you gave the best description
of English home life?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“‘Wives and Daughters,’” said Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, let us get it then, and afterward we will take a turn
above Walkendorf’s Tower, and see if there is any sign of our
vessels from Iceland.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You heard good news of them last month, did you not?”
asked Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No definite news, but everything was very hopeful. They
sent word by the steamer to Granton, and telegraphed from
there to our station in Öifjord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did they say?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That as yet there was no catch of herrings, but that everything
was most promising, as plenty of whales were seen every
day at the mouth of the fjord. Oh, I am perfectly satisfied.
I have had no anxiety about the expedition since then.” So
father and daughter set out together. It was a clear frosty
morning, the wintry air was invigorating, and Sigrid thought
she had never seen her father look so well before; his step
seemed so light, his brow so smooth, his eyes so unclouded.
Beyer’s shop had fascinations for them both; she lingered long
in the neighborhood of the Tauchnitz shelves, while Herr
Falck discussed the news with some one behind the counter,
and admired the pictures so temptingly displayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here, Sigrid!” he exclaimed. “Did you ever see a
prettier little water-color than that? Bergen in winter, from
the harbor. What is the price of it? A hundred kroner? I
must really have it. It shall be a present to you in memory of
our walk.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid was delighted with the picture, and Herr Falck himself
seemed as pleased with it as a child with a new toy. They
talked away together, planning where it should hang at home
and saying how it was just the sort of thing Frithiof would like.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is quite a pity he did not see it when he was away in
Germany, he would have liked to have it when he was suffering
from <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</span></i>,” said Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, all that sort of thing is over for him, I hope,” said
Herr Falck. “No need that he should be away from Bergen
any more, except now and then for a holiday. And if ever you
marry a foreigner, Sigrid, you will be able to take Bergen with
you as a consolation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They made their way up to a little wooded hill above the
fortress, which commanded a wide and beautiful view.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” cried Herr Falck. “Look there, Sigrid! Look,
look! there is surely a vessel coming.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She gazed out seaward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“You have better eyes than I have, father. Whereabouts?
Oh! yes, now I see, ever so far away. Do you think it is one
of yours?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t tell yet,” said Herr Falck; and glancing at him she
saw that he was in an agony of impatience, and that the old
troubled look had come back to his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the nameless fear which had seized her in the summer
took possession of her. She would not bother him with questions,
but waited silently beside him, wondering why he was so
unusually excited, wishing that she understood business matters,
longing for Frithiof, who would perhaps have known all about
it and could have reassured her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” cried Herr Falck at length, “I am almost sure
it is one of our Öifjord vessels. Yes! I am certain it is the
‘Solid.’ Now the great question is this—is she loaded or only
ballasted?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fresh, strong wind kept blowing Sigrid’s fringe about
distractingly; sheltering her eyes with her hand, she looked
again eagerly at the approaching vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think she is rather low in the water, father, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope so—I hope so,” said Herr Falck, and he took off
his spectacles and began to wipe the dim glasses with fingers
that trembled visibly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ship was drawing nearer and nearer, and every moment
Sigrid realized more that it was not as she had first
hoped. Undoubtedly the vessel was high in the water. She
glanced apprehensively at her father.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t bear this any longer, Sigrid,” he exclaimed. “We
will go down to Tydskebryggen, and take a boat and row out
to her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They hurried away, speaking never a word. Sigrid feared
that her father would send her home, thinking it would be cold
for her on the water, but he allowed her to get into the little
boat in silence, perhaps scarcely realizing her presence, too
much taken up with his great anxiety to think of anything
else. As they threaded their way through the busy harbor,
she began to feel a little more cheerful. Perhaps, after all, the
matter was not so serious. The sun shone brightly on the
sparkling water; the sailors and laborers on the vessels and
the quays shouted and talked at their work; on a steamer,
which they passed, one of the men was cleaning the brass-work
and singing blithely the familiar tune of “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Sönner av Norge</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must hope for the best,” said Herr Falck, perhaps
also feeling the influence of the cheerful tune.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Just as they neared the “Solid” the anchor dropped.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You had better wait here,” said Heir Falck, “while I go
on board. I’ll not keep you long, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, anxious waiting always does seem long, and
Sigrid, spite of her sealskin jacket, shivered as she sat in the
little boat. It was not so much the cold that made her shiver,
as that horrible nameless dread, that anxiety which weighed so
much more heavily because she did not fully understand it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When her father rejoined her, her worst fears were realized.
He neither looked at her nor spoke to her, but, just giving a
word of direction to the boatman, sat down in his place with
folded arms and bent head. She knew instantly that some terrible
disaster must have happened, but she did not dare to ask
what it was; she just sat still listening to the monotonous stroke
of the oars, and with an uneasy wonder in her mind as to what
would happen next. They were nearing the shore, and at last
her father spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pay the man, Sigrid,” he said, and with an unsteady hand
he gave her his purse. He got out of the boat first and she
fancied she saw him stagger, but the next moment he recovered
himself and turned to help her. They walked away
together in the direction of the office.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must not be too anxious, dear child,” he said. “I
will explain all to you this evening. I have had a heavy
loss.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, little father, you look so ill,” pleaded Sigrid. “Must
you indeed go to the office? Why not come home and
rest?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rest!” said Herr Falck dreamily. “Rest? No, not just
yet—not just yet. Send the carriage for me this afternoon,
and say nothing about it to any one—I’ll explain it to you
later on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So the father and daughter parted, and Sigrid went home to
bear as best she could her day of suspense. Herr Falck
returned later on, looking very ill, and complaining of headache.
She persuaded him to lie down in his study, and would
not ask him the question which was trembling on her lips.
But in the evening he spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a good child, Sigrid, a good child,” he said,
caressing her hand. “And now you must hear all, though I
would give much to keep it from you. The Iceland expedition
has failed, dear; the vessels have come back empty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does it mean such a very great loss to you, father?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“I will explain to you,” he said, more eagerly; “I should
like you to understand how it has come about. For some time
trade has been very bad; and last year and the year before I
had some heavy losses connected with the Lofoten part of the
business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed to take almost a pleasure in giving her all sorts
of details which she could not half-understand; she heard in a
confused way of the three steamers sent to Nordland in the
summer with empty barrels and salt for the herrings; she heard
about buying at the Bourse of Bergen large quantities, so that
Herr Falck had ten thousand barrels at a time, and had been
obliged to realize them at ruinous prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You do not understand all this, my Sigrid,” he said, smiling
at her puzzled face. “Well, I’ll tell you the rest more
simply. Things were looking as bad as possible, and when in
the summer I heard that Haugesund had caught thousands of
barrels of herrings in the fjords of Iceland, I made up my mind
to try the same plan, and to stake all on that last throw. I
chartered sailing vessels, hired hands, bought nets, and the
expedition set off—I knew that if it came back with full barrels
I should be a rich man, and that if it failed, there was no help
for it—my business must go to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid gave a little cry. “You will be bankrupt?” she
exclaimed. “Oh, surely not that, father—not that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She remembered all too vividly the bankruptcy of a well-known
timber merchant some years before; she knew that he
had raised money by borrowing on the Bank of Norway and
on the Savings Bank of Bergen, and she knew that it was the
custom of the land that the banks, avoiding risk in that way,
demanded two sureties for the loan, and that the failure of a
large firm caused distress far and wide to an extent hardly conceivable
to foreigners.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is yet one hope,” said Herr Falck. “If the rumor
I heard in the summer is false, and if I can still keep the connection
with Morgans, that guarantees me seven thousand two
hundred kroner a year, and in that case I have no doubt we
could avoid open bankruptcy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how?” said Sigrid. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Morgans would never keep me as their agent if I were
declared a bankrupt, and, to avoid that, I think my creditors
would accept as payment the outcome of all my property, and
would give me what we call voluntary agreement; it is a form
of winding up a failing concern which is very often employed.
They would be the gainers in the long run, because of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>they would not allow me to keep my seven thousand two hundred
kroner untouched, so in any case, my child, I have
brought you to poverty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He covered his face with his hands. Sigrid noticed that the
veins about his temples stood out like blue cords, so much
were they enlarged.</p>

<p class='c000'>She put her arm about him, kissing his hair, his hands, his
forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not mind poverty, little father. I mind only that you
are so troubled,” she said. “And surely, surely they will not
take the agency from you after all these years! Oh, poverty
will be nothing, if only we can keep from disgrace—if only
others need not be dragged down too!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They were interrupted by a tap at the door, and Swanhild
stole in, making the pretty little courtesy without which no
well-bred Norwegian child enters or leaves a room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mayn’t I come and say good-night to you, little father?”
she asked. “I got on ever so well at school, just as you said,
after our merry breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sight of the child’s unconscious happiness was more
than he could endure; he closed his eyes that she might not
see the scalding tears which filled them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How dreadfully ill father looks,” said Swanhild uneasily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His head is very bad,” said Sigrid. “Kiss him, dear, and
then run to bed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Herr Falck roused himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I too will go up,” he said. “Bed is the best place, eh,
Swanhild? God bless you, little one; good-night. What, are
you going to be my walking-stick?”</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus, steadying himself by the child, he went up to his
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>At breakfast the next morning he was in his place as usual,
but he seemed very poorly, and afterward made no suggestion
as to going down to the office, but lay on the sofa in his study,
drowsily watching the flames in his favorite English fireplace.
Sigrid went about the house busy with her usual duties, and
for the time so much absorbed that she almost forgot the great
trouble hanging over them. About eleven o’clock there was a
ring at the door-bell; the servant brought in a telegram for
Herr Falck. A sort of wild hope seized her that it might be
from Frithiof. If anything could cheer her father on that day
it would be to hear that all was happily settled, and, taking it
from the maid, she bore it herself into her father’s room. He
rose from the sofa as she entered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I am better, Sigrid,” he said. “I think I could go to the
office. Ah! a telegram for me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It has come this minute,” she said, watching him as he sat
down before his desk, adjusted his spectacles, and tore open
the envelope. If only Frithiof could send news that would
cheer him! If only some little ray of brightness would come
to lighten that dark day! She had so persuaded herself that
the message must be from Frithiof that the thought of the business
anxieties had become for the time quite subservient. The
telegram was a long one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How extravagant that boy is!” she thought to herself.
“Why, it would have been enough if he had just put ‘All
right.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a sudden cry broke from her, for her father had bowed
his head on his desk like a man who is overwhelmed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Father, father!” she cried, “oh! what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a minute or two neither spoke nor moved. At last, with
an effort, he raised himself. He looked up at her with a face
of fixed despair, with eyes whose anguish wrung her heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” he said, in a voice unlike his own, “they have taken
the agency from me. I am bankrupt!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She put her hand in his, too much stunned to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor children!” he moaned. “Ah! my God! my God!
Why—?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sentence was never ended. He fell heavily forward:
whether he was dead or only fainting she could not tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>She rushed to the door calling for help, and the servants
came hurrying to the study. They helped to move their master
to the sofa, and Sigrid found a sort of comfort in the assurances
of her old nurse that it was nothing but a paralytic seizure, that
he would soon revive. The good old soul knew nothing, nor
was she so hopeful as she seemed, but her words helped Sigrid
to keep up; she believed them in the unreasoning sort of way
in which those in trouble always do catch at the slightest hope
held out to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will send Olga for the doctor,” she said breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay, and for your uncle, too,” said the nurse. “He’s your
own mother’s brother, and ought to be here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps,” said Sigrid hesitatingly. “Yes, Olga, go to
Herr Grönvold’s house and just tell them of my father’s illness.
But first for the doctor—as quick as you can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There followed a miserable time of waiting and suspense.
Herr Falck was still perfectly unconscious; there were signs
of shock about his face, which was pale and rigid, the eyelids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>closed, the head turned to one side. Sigrid took his cold hand
in hers, and sat with her fingers on the pulse; she could just
feel it, but it was very feeble and very rapid. Thus they waited
till the doctor came. He was an old friend, and Sigrid felt
almost at rest when she had told him all he wanted to know as
to the beginning of the attack and the cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You had better send for your brother at once,” he said.
“I suppose he will be at the office?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no!” she said, trembling. “Frithiof is in England.
But we will telegraph to him to come home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My poor child,” said the old doctor kindly, “if he is in
England it would be of no possible use; he would not be in
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She covered her face with her hands, for the first time utterly
breaking down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! is there no hope?” she sobbed. “No hope at all?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Remember how much he is spared,” said the doctor
gently. “He will not suffer. He will not suffer at all any
more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so it proved; for while many went and came, and while
the bad news of the bankruptcy caused Herr Grönvold to pace
the room like one distracted, and while Sigrid and Swanhild
kept their sad watch, Herr Falck lay in painless quiet—his face
so calm that, had it not been for an occasional tremor passing
through the paralyzed limbs, they would almost have thought
he was already dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hours passed on. At length little Swanhild, who had
crouched down on the floor with her head in Sigrid’s lap,
became conscious of a sort of stir in the room. She looked up
and saw that the doctor was bending over her father.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is over,” he said, in a hushed voice as he stood up and
glanced toward the two girls.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Swanhild, who had never seen any one die, but had
read in books of death struggles and death agonies, was filled
with a great wonder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was so quiet,” she said, afterward to her sister. “I never
knew people died like that; I don’t think I shall ever feel
afraid about dying again. But oh, Sigrid!” and the child broke
into a passion of tears, “we have got to go on living all alone—all
alone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid’s breast heaved. Alas! the poor child little knew all
the troubles that were before them; as far as possible she must
try to shield her from the knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We three must love each other very much, darling,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>said, folding her arms about Swanhild. “We must try and be
everything to each other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words made her think of Frithiof, and with a sick longing
for his presence she went downstairs again to speak to her
uncle, and to arrange as to how the news should be sent to
England. Herr Grönvold had never quite appreciated his
brother-in-law, and this had always made a barrier between
him and his nephew and nieces. He was the only relation,
however, to whom Sigrid could turn, and she knew that he was
her father’s executor, and must be consulted about all the
arrangements. Had not she and Frithiof celebrated their
twenty-first birthday just a week ago, Herr Grönvold would
have been their guardian, and naturally he would still expect
to have the chief voice in the family counsels.</p>

<p class='c000'>She found him in the sitting-room. He was still pale and
agitated. She knew only too well that although he would not
say a word against her dead father, yet in his heart he would
always blame him, and that the family disgrace would be more
keenly felt by him than by any one. The sight of him entirely
checked her tears; she sat down and began to talk to him
quite calmly. All her feeling of youth and helplessness was
gone now—she felt old, strangely old; her voice sounded like
the voice of some one else—it seemed to have grown cold and
hard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What must we do about telling Frithiof, uncle?” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have thought of that,” said Herr Grönvold. “It is impossible
that he could be back in time for the funeral. This is
Tuesday afternoon, and he could not catch this week’s steamer,
which leaves Hull at nine o’clock to-night. The only thing is
to telegraph the news to him, poor boy. His best chance now
is to stay in England and try to find some opening there, for
he has no chance here at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid caught her breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You mean that he had better not even come back?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, I think England is the only hope for him,” said
Herr Grönvold, perhaps hardly understanding what a terrible
blow he was giving to his niece. “He is absolutely penniless,
and over here the feeling will be so strong against the very
name of Falck that he would never work his way up. I will
gladly provide for you and Swanhild until he is able to make a
home for you; but he must stay in England, there is no help
for that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She could not dispute the point any further; her uncle’s
words had shown her only too plainly the true meaning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>word “bankrupt.” Why, the very chair she was sitting on was
no longer her own! A chill passed over her as she glanced
round the familiar room. On the writing-table she noticed
her housekeeping books, and realized that there was no longer
any money to pay them with; on the bookshelf stood the
clock presented a year or two ago to her father by the clerks
in his office—that too must be parted with; everything most
sacred, most dear to her, everything associated with her happy
childhood and youth must be swept away in the vain endeavor
to satisfy the just claims of her father’s creditors. In a sort of
dreadful dream she sat watching her uncle as he wrote the
message to Frithiof, hesitating long over the wording of
the sad tidings, and ever and anon counting the words carefully
with his pen. It would cost a good deal, that telegram
to England. Sigrid knew that her uncle would pay for it,
and the knowledge kept her lips sealed. It was absurd to
long so to send love and sympathy at the rate of thirty öre
a word! Why, in the whole world she had not so much as a
ten-öre piece! Her personal possessions might, perhaps, legally
belong to her, but she knew that there was something within
her which would utterly prevent her being able to consider
them her own. Everything must go toward those who would
suffer from her father’s failure; and Frithiof would feel just
as she did about the matter, of that she was certain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There, poor fellow,” said Herr Grönvold, “that will give
him just the facts of the case: and you must write to him,
Sigrid, and I, too, will write by the next mail.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am afraid he cannot get a letter till next Monday,” said
Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, there is no help for that,” said Herr Grönvold. “I
shall do all that can be done with regard to the business; that
he will know quite well, and his return later on would be a
mere waste of time and money. He must seek work in London
without delay, and I have told him so. Do you think this is
clear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He handed her the message he had written, and she read it
through, though each word was like a stab.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite clear,” she said, returning it to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her voice was so tired and worn that it attracted his notice
for the first time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear,” he said kindly, “it has been a terrible day for
you; you had better go to bed and rest. Leave everything to
me. I promise you all shall be attended to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very kind,” she said, yet with all the time a terrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>craving for something more than this sort of kindness, for
something which was perhaps beyond Herr Grönvold’s power
to give.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you like your aunt or one of your cousins to spend
the night here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she said; “I am better alone. They will come to-morrow.
I—I will rest now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. Good-by, then, my dear. I will send off the
telegram at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She heard the door close behind him with a sense of relief,
yet before many minutes had passed, the dreadful quiet of the
house seemed almost more than she could endure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Frithiof, Frithiof! why did you ever go to England?”
she moaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as she sat crouched together in one of the deep easy-chairs,
it seemed to her that the physical faintness, the feeling
that everything was sliding away from her, was but the shadow
of the bitter reality. She was roused by the opening of the
door. Her old nurse stole in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here, Sigrid,” said the old woman. “The pastor has
come. You will see him in here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think I can,” she said wearily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is in the dining-room talking to Swanhild,” said the
nurse: “you had better just see him a minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But still Sigrid did not stir. It was only when little Swanhild
stole in, with her wistful, tear-stained face, that she even
tried to rouse herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” said the child, “Herr Askevold has been out all
day with some one who was dying; he is very tired and
has had no dinner; he says if he may he will have supper
with us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid at once started to her feet; her mind was for the
moment diverted from her own troubles; it was the thought of
the dear old pastor, tired and hungry, yet coming to them,
nevertheless, which touched her heart. Other friends might
perhaps forsake them in their trouble and disgrace, but not
Herr Askevold. Later on, when she thought it over, she knew
that it was for the sake of inducing them to eat, and for the
sake of helping them through that terrible first meal without
their father, that he had come in just then. She only felt the
relief of his presence at the time, was only conscious that she
was less desolate because the old white-haired man, who had
baptized her as a baby and confirmed her as a girl, was sitting
with them at the supper-table. His few words of sympathy as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>he greeted her had been the first words of comfort which had
reached her heart, and now, as he cut the bread and helped
the fish, there was something in the very smallness and fineness
of his consideration and care for them which filled her with far
more gratitude than Herr Grönvold’s offer of a home. They
did not talk very much during the meal, but little Swanhild
ceased to wonder whether it was wrong to feel so hungry on
such a day, and, no longer ashamed of her appetite, went on
naturally and composedly with her supper; while Sigrid, with
her strong Norwegian sense of hospitality, ate for her guest’s
sake, and in thinking of his wants was roused from her state of
blank hopelessness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterward she took him to her father’s room, her tears
stealing down quietly as she looked once more on the calm,
peaceful face that would never again bear the look of strained
anxiety which had of late grown so familiar to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Herr Askevold knelt by the bedside and prayed. She
could never quite remember in after-days what it was that he
said, perhaps she never very clearly took in the actual words;
but something, either in his tone or manner, brought to her the
sense of a presence altogether above all the changes that had
been or ever could be. This new consciousness seemed to fill
her with strength, and a great tenderness for Swanhild came
to her heart; she wondered how it was she could ever have
fancied that all had been taken from her.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they rose from their knees and the old pastor took her
hand in his to wish her good-by, he glanced a little anxiously
into her eyes. But something he saw there comforted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless you, my child,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And again as they opened the front door to him and he
stepped out into the dark wintry night, he looked back, and
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“God comfort you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid stood on the threshold, behind her the lighted hall,
before her the starless gloom of the outer world, her arm was
round little Swanhild, and as she bade him good-night, she
smiled, one of those brave, patient smiles that are sadder than
tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The light behind her, and the dark before,” said the old
pastor to himself as he walked home wearily enough. “It is
like her life, poor child. And yet I am somehow not much
afraid for her. It is for Frithiof I am afraid.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>When Frithiof found that instead of addressing a stranger
at Hyde Park Corner, he had actually spoken to Roy Boniface,
his first feeling had been of mere blank astonishment. Then
he vehemently wished himself alone once more, and cursed the
fate which had first brought him into contact with the little
child by the Serpentine, and which had now actually thrown
him into the arms of a being who would talk and expect to be
talked to. Yet this feeling also passed; for as he looked down
the unfamiliar roads, and felt once more the desolateness of
a foreigner in a strange country, he was obliged to own that it
was pleasant to him to hear Roy’s well-known voice, and to
feel that there was in London a being who took some sort of
interest in his affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I had seen you a minute or two sooner; my mother
and my sister were in that carriage,” said Roy, “and they
would have liked to meet you. You must come and see us
some day, or are you quite too busy to spare time for such an
out-of-the-way place as Brixton?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you. My plans are very uncertain,” said Frithiof.
“I shall probably only be over here for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you come across the Morgans?” asked Roy, “or any
of our other companions at Balholm?”</p>

<p class='c000'>In his heart he felt sure that the young Norwegian’s visit
was connected with Blanche Morgan, for their mutual liking
had been common property at Balholm, and even the semiengagement
was shrewdly guessed at by many of the other
tourists.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof knew this, and the question was like a sword-thrust
to him. Had it not been so nearly dark Roy could hardly
have failed to notice his change of color and expression. But
he had great self-control, and his voice was quite steady,
though a little cold and monotonous in tone, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have just been to call on the Morgans, and have only
just learned that their business relations with our firm are at
an end. The connection is of so many years’ standing that I
am afraid it will be a great blow to my father.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Roy began to see daylight, and perceived, what had first
escaped his notice, that some great change had passed over his
companion since they parted on the Sogne Fjord; very possibly
the business relations might affect his hopes, and make
the engagement no longer possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was bad news to greet you,” he said with an uneasy
consciousness that it was very difficult to know what to say.
“Herr Falck would feel a change of that sort keenly, I should
think. What induced them to make it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Self-interest,” said Frithiof, still in the same tone. “No
doubt they came to spy out the land in the summer. As the
head of the firm remarked to me just now, it is impossible to
sentimentalize over old connections—business is business, and
of course they are bound to look out for themselves—what
happens to us is, naturally, no affair of theirs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy would not have thought much of the sarcasm of this
speech if it had been spoken by any one else, but from the
lips of such a fellow as Frithiof Falck, it startled him.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were walking along Piccadilly, each of them turning
over in his mind how he could best get away from the other,
yet with an uneasy feeling that they were in some way linked
together by that summer holiday, and that if they parted now
they would speedily regret it. Roy, with the increasing consciousness
of his companion’s trouble only grew more perplexed
and ill at ease. He tried to picture to himself the
workings of the Norwegian’s mind, and as they walked on in
silence some faint idea of the effect of the surroundings upon
the new-comer began to dawn upon him. What a contrast
was all this to quiet Norway! The brightly lighted shops, the
busy streets, the hurry and bustle, the ever-changing crowd of
strange faces.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know many people in London?” he asked, willing
to shift his responsibility if possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Frithiof, “I do not know a soul.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He relapsed into silence. Roy’s thoughts went back to his
first day at Bergen; he seemed to live it all through once
more; he remembered how Frithiof Falck had got the Linnæa
for them, how he had taken them for shelter to his father’s
house; the simplicity and the happiness of the scene came
back to him vividly, and he glanced at his companion as though
to verify his past impressions. The light from a street lamp
fell on Frithiof at that moment, and Roy started; the Norwegian
had perhaps forgotten that he was not alone, at any rate
he wore an expression which had not hitherto been visible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>There was something about his pale, set face which alarmed
Roy, and scattered to the winds all his selfishness and awkward
shyness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you will of course dine with me,” he said, “since
you have no other engagement.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Frithiof, still wishing to be alone, and yet still dreading
it, thanked him and accepted the invitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ice once broken, they got on rather better, and as they
dined together Roy carefully abstained from talking of the
days at Balholm, but asked after Sigrid and Swanhild and Herr
Falck, talked of the winter in Norway, of skating, of Norwegian
politics, of everything he could think of which could divert his
friend’s mind from the Morgans.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What next,” he said, as they found themselves once more
in the street. “Since you go back soon we ought to make the
most of the time. Shall we come to the Savoy? You must
certainly hear a Gilbert and Sullivan opera before you
leave.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not in the mood for it to-night,” said Frithiof. “And
it has just struck me that possibly my father may telegraph instructions
to me—he would have got Morgan’s telegram this
morning. I will go back to the Arundel and see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This idea seemed to rouse him. He became much more like
himself, and as they walked down the Strand the conversation
dragged much less. For the first time he spoke of the work
that awaited him on his return to Bergen, and Roy began to
think that his scheme for diverting him from his troubles had
been on the whole a success.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must arrange what day you will come down to us at
Brixton,” he said, as they turned down Arundel Street.
“Would to-morrow suit you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As far as I know, it would,” said Frithiof; “but if you
will just come into the hotel with me we will find out if there
is any message from my father. If there is nothing, why, I am
perfectly free. It is possible, though, that he will have business
for me to see to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly they went into the hotel together, and Frithiof
accosted a waiter in the entrance hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Anything come for me since I went out?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, I believe there is, sir. Herr Falck, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He brought forward a telegram and handed it to Frithiof,
who hurriedly tore open the orange envelope and began eagerly
to read. As he read, every shade of color left his face; the
telegram was in Norwegian, and its terse, matter of-fact statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>overwhelmed him. Like one in some dreadful dream he
read the words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father bankrupt, owing to failure Iceland expedition, also
loss Morgan’s agency.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was more beyond, but this so staggered him that he
looked up from the fatal pink paper with a sort of wild hope
that his surroundings would reassure him, that he should find
it all a mistake. He met the curious eyes of the waiter, he
saw two girls in evening-dress crossing the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We ought to be at the Lyceum by this time!” he heard
one of them say to the other. “How annoying of father to be
so late!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl addressed had a sweet sunshiny face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, he will soon be here,” she said, smiling, but as her
eyes happened to fall on Frithiof she grew suddenly grave and
compassionate; she seemed to glance from his face to the
telegram in his hand, and her look brought him a horrible perception
that after all this was real waking existence. It was a
real telegram he held, it was all true, hideously true. His
father was bankrupt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shame, misery, bitter indignation with the Morgans, a sickening
perception that if Blanche had been true to him the
worst might have been averted, all this seethed in his mind.
With a desperate effort he steadied his hand and again bent his
eye on the pink paper and the large round-hand scrawl. Oh, yes,
there was no mistake, he read the fatal words again:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father bankrupt, owing to failure Iceland expedition, also
loss Morgan’s agency.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time he had partly recovered, was sufficiently himself
again to feel some sort of anxiety to read the rest of the message.
Possibly there was something he might do to help his
father. He read on and took in the next sentence almost at a
glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shock caused cerebral hemorrhage. He died this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frithiof felt a choking sensation in his throat; if he could
not get out into the open air he felt that he should die, and by
an instinct he turned toward the door, made a step or two forward,
then staggered and caught at Roy Boniface to save himself
from falling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Roy held him up and looked at him anxiously. “You have
had bad news?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof tried to speak, but no words would come; he gasped
for breath, felt his limbs failing, saw a wavy, confused picture
of the vestibule, the waiter, the two girls, an elderly gentleman
joining them, then felt himself guided down on to the floor, never
quite losing consciousness, yet helpless either to speak or move
and with a most confused sense of what had passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is in Norwegian,” he heard Roy say. “Bad news from
his home, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor fellow!” said another voice. “Open the door some
one. It’s air he wants.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I saw there was something wrong, father,” this was in a
girl’s voice. “He looked quite dazed with trouble as he
read.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll be late for the Lyceum,” thought Frithiof, and making
an effort to get up, he sunk for a moment into deeper depths
of faintness; the voices died away into indistinctness, then
came a consciousness of hands at his shoulders and his feet;
he was lifted up and carried away somewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Struggling back to life again in a few moments, he found
that he was lying on a bed, the window was wide open, and a
single candle flickered wildly in the draught. Roy Boniface
was standing by him holding a glass of water to his lips. With
an effort he drank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are better, sir?” asked the waiter. “Anything I can
do for you, sir? Any answer to the telegram?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The telegram! What do you mean?” exclaimed Frithiof.
Then as full recollection came back to him, he turned his face
from the light with a groan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The gentleman had, perhaps, better see a doctor,” suggested
the waiter to Roy. But Frithiof turned upon him
sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am better. You can go away. All I want is to be
alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man retired, but Roy still lingered. He could not
make up his mind to leave any one in such a plight, so he
crossed the room and stood by the open window looking out
gravely at the dark river with its double row of lights and their
long shining reflections. Presently a sound in the room made
him turn. Frithiof had dragged himself up to his feet, with
an impatient gesture he blew out the flickering candle, then
walked with unsteady steps to the window and dropped into a
chair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“So you are here still?” he said, with something of relief
in his tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I couldn’t bear to leave till you were all right again,” said
Roy. “Wont you tell me what is the matter, Falck?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father is dead,” said Frithiof, in an unnaturally calm
voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dead!” exclaimed Roy, and his tone had in it much more
of awe and regret. He could hardly believe that the genial,
kindly Norwegian who had climbed Munkeggen with them only
a few weeks before was actually no longer in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is dead,” repeated Frithiof quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how was it?” asked Roy. “It must have been so
sudden. You left him well only three days ago. How was it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“His Iceland expedition had failed,” said Frithiof; “that
meant a fatal blow to his business; then, this morning, there
came to him Morgan’s telegram about the agency. It was that
that killed him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good God!” exclaimed Roy, with indignation in his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leave out the adjective,” said Frithiof bitterly. “If
there’s a God at all He is hard and merciless. Business is
business, you see—one can’t sentimentalize over old connections.
God allows men like Morgan to succeed, they always
do succeed, and He lets men like my father be dragged down
into shame and dishonor and ruin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy was silent; he had no glib, conventional sentences
ready to hand. In his own mind he frankly admitted that
the problem was beyond him. He knew quite well that far
too often in business life it was the pushing, unscrupulous,
selfish man who made his fortune, and the man of Herr Falck’s
type, sensitive, conscientious, altogether honorable, who had
to content himself with small means, or who, goaded at last to
rashness, staked all on a desperate last throw and failed. It
was a problem that perplexed him every day of his life, the
old, old problem which Job dashed his heart against, and for
which only Job’s answer will suffice. Vaguely he felt that
there must be some other standard of success than that of the
world; he believed that it was but the first act of the drama
which we could at present see; but he honestly owned that
the first act was often perplexing enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, it was his very silence which attracted Frithiof;
had he spoken, had he argued, had he put forth the usual
platitudes, the two would have been forever separated. But
he just leaned against the window-frame, looking out at the
dark river, musing over the story he had just heard, and wondering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>what the meaning of it could be. The “Why?” which
had been the last broken ejaculation of the dead man echoed
in the hearts of these two who had been brought together so
strangely. Into Roy’s mind there came the line, “’Tis held
that sorrow makes us wise.” But he had a strong feeling that
in Frithiof’s case sorrow would harden and imbitter; indeed,
it seemed to him already that his companion’s whole nature
was changed. It was almost difficult to believe that he was
the same high-spirited boy who had been the life of the party
at Balholm, who had done the honors of the villa in Kalvedalen
so pleasantly. And then as he contrasted that bright,
homely room at Bergen with this dark, forlorn hotel room in
London, a feeling that he must get his companion away into
some less dreary atmosphere took possession of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t stay all alone in this place,” he said abruptly.
“Come home with me to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very good,” said Frithiof, “but I don’t think I
can do that. I am better alone, and indeed must make up my
mind to-night as to the future.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will go back to Norway, I suppose?” asked Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I suppose so; as soon as possible. To-morrow I
must see if there is any possibility of getting back in fair
time. Unluckily, it is too late for the Wilson Line steamer,
which must be starting at this minute from Hull.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will come in to-morrow, then, and see what you have
decided on,” said Roy. “Is there nothing I can do for you
now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing, thank you,” said Frithiof. And Roy, feeling
that he could be of no more use, and that his presence was
perhaps a strain on his friend, wished him good-night and
went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day he was detained by business and could not
manage to call at the Arundel till late in the afternoon. Noticing
the same waiter in the hall who had been present on the
previous evening, he inquired if Frithiof were in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Herr Falck has gone, sir,” said the man; “he went off about
an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gone!” exclaimed Roy, in some surprise. “Did he leave
any message?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir; none at all. He was looking very ill when he
came down this morning, but went out as soon as he had had
breakfast, and didn’t come back till four o’clock. Then he
called for his bill and ordered his portmanteau to be brought
down and put on a hansom, and as he passed out he gave me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>a trifle, and said he had spoken a bit sharp to me last night,
he was afraid, and thanked me for what I had done for him.
And so he drove off, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You didn’t hear where he was going to?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir; I can’t say as I did. The cab, if I remember
right, turned along the Embankment, toward Charing Cross.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” said Roy. “Very possibly he may have
gone back to Norway by the Continent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And with a feeling of vague disappointment he turned away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='X' class='c005'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When Roy Boniface had gone Frithiof sat for a long time
without stirring. He had longed to be alone, and yet the
moment he had got his wish the most crushing sense of desolation
overwhelmed him. He, too, was keenly conscious of that
change in his own nature which had been quite apparent to
Roy. It seemed to him that everything had been taken from
him in one blow—love, hope, his father, his home, his stainless
name, his occupation, his fortune, and even his old self. It
was an entirely different character with which he now had to
reckon, and an entirely new life which he had to live. Both
character and surroundings had been suddenly changed very
much for the worse. He had got to put up with them, and
somehow to endure life. That was the only thing clear to him.
The little child by the Serpentine had given him so much
standing-ground, but he had not an inch more at present; all
around him was a miserable, cheerless, gray mist. Presently,
becoming aware that the cold wind from the river was no
longer reviving him but chilling him to the bone, he roused
himself to close the window. Mechanically he drew down the
blind, struck a light, and noticing that on the disordered bed
there lay the crumpled pink paper which had brought him the
bad news, he picked it up, smoothed it out, and read it once
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was still something which he had not seen in the first
horrible shock of realizing his father’s death. With darkening
brow he read the words which Herr Grönvold had weighed so
carefully and counted so often.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will provide for your sisters till you can. Impossible for
you to return in time for funeral. My advice is try for work
in London. No opening here for you, as feeling will be strong
against family.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was only then that he actually took in the fact that he was
penniless—indeed, far worse than penniless—weighed down by
a load of debts which, if not legally his, were his burden none
the less. There were, as he well knew, many who failed with a
light heart, who were bankrupt one week and starting afresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>with perfect unconcern the next, but he was too much his
father’s son to take the disaster that way. The disgrace and
the perception of being to blame which had killed Herr Falck
now fell upon him with crushing force; he paced the room like
one distracted, always with the picture before him of what was
now going on in Bergen, always with the thought of the suffering
and misery which would result from the failure of a firm so
old and so much respected as his father’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet it was out of this very torture of realization
that his comfort at last sprung—such comfort at least as he
was at present capable of receiving. We must all have some
sort of future to look to, some sort of aim before us, or life
would be intolerable. The veriest beggar in the street concentrates
his thought on the money to be made, or the shelter
to be gained for the coming night. And there came, fortunately,
to Frithiof, jilted, ruined, bereaved as he was, one strong
desire—one firm resolve. He would pay off his father’s debts
to the last farthing; he would work, he would slave, he would
deny himself all but the bare necessities of life. The name of
Falck should yet be redeemed; and a glow of returning hope
rose in his heart as he remembered his father’s parting words,
“I look to you, Frithiof, to carry out the aims in which I myself
have failed, to live the life I could wish to have lived.”
Yet how different all had been when those words had been
spoken! The recollection of them did him good—brought
him, as it were, back to life again—but at the same time they
were the most cruel pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw again the harbor at Bergen, the ships, the mountains,
the busy quay; he saw his father so vividly that it seemed
to him as if he must actually be before him at that very moment,
the tone of his voice rang in his ears, the pressure of his
hand seemed yet to linger with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>What wonder that it should still be so fresh in his memory?
It was only three days ago. Only three days! Yet the time
to look back on now seemed more like three years. With
amazement he dwelt on the fact, thinking, as we mostly do in
sudden trouble, how little time it takes for things to happen.
It is a perception that does not come to us in the full swing of
life, when all seems safe and full of bright promise, any more
than in yachting it troubles us to reflect that there is only a
plank between ourselves and the unfathomed depths of the
sea. We expect all to go well, we feel no fear, we enjoy life
easily, and when disaster comes its rude haste astounds us—so
much is changed in one sudden, crushing blow.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>He remembered how he had whistled the “Bridal Song of
the Hardanger,” as he cheerfully paced the deck full of
thoughts of Blanche and of the bright future that was opening
before him. The tune rang in his ears now with a mournful
persistence. He buried his face in his hands, letting the
flood of grief sweep over him, opposing to it no thought of
comfort, no recollection of what was still left to him. If
Blanche had been faithful to him all might have been different;
her father would never have taken away the agency if
she had told him the truth when she first got home; the Iceland
expedition might have failed, but his father could have
got voluntary agreement with his creditors, he himself might
perhaps have been put at the head of the branch at Stavanger,
all would have been well.</p>

<p class='c000'>In bitter contrast he called up a picture of the desolate
house in Kalvedalen, thought of Herr Grönvold making the
final arrangements, and alternately pitying and blaming his
brother-in-law; thought of Sigrid and Swanhild in their sorrow
and loneliness; thought of his father lying cold and still.
Choking sobs rose in his throat as more and more clearly he
realized that all was indeed over, that he should never see his
father again. But his eyes were dry and tearless, the iron had
entered into his soul, and all the relief that was then possible
for him lay in a prompt endeavor to carry out the resolve
which he had just made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps he perceived this, for he raised himself, banished the
mind pictures which had absorbed him so long, and began to
think what his first practical step must be. He would lose no
time, he would begin that very moment. The first thing must
of course be retrenchment; he must leave the Arundel on the
morrow and must seek out the cheapest rooms to be had.
Lying on the table was that invaluable book “Dickens’ Dictionary
of London.” He had bought it at Hull on the previous
day, and had already got out of it much amusement and
much information. Now, in grim earnest, he turned over its
well-arranged pages till he came to the heading “Lodgings,”
running his eye hurriedly over the paragraph, and pausing over
the following sentence: “Those who desire still cheaper
accommodation must go further afield, the lowest priced of all
being in the northeast and southeast districts, in either of
which a bed and sitting-room may be had at rents varying from
ten shillings, and even less, to thirty shillings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned to the maps at the beginning, and decided to try
the neighborhood of Vauxhall and Lambeth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Next came the question of work. And here the vastness of
the field perplexed him, where to turn he had not the slightest
idea. Possibly Dickens might suggest something. He turned
over the pages, and his eye happened to light on the words,
“Americans in distress, Society for the relief of.” He scanned
the columns closely, there seemed to be help for every one on
earth except a Norwegian. There was a home for French
strangers; a Hungarian aid society; an Italian benevolent;
sixteen charities for Jews; an association of Poles; a Hibernian
society; a Netherlands benevolent; a Portuguese and
Spanish aid; and a society for distressed Belgians. The only
chance for him lay in the “Universal Beneficence Society,” a
title which called up a bitter smile to his lips, or the “Society
of Friends of Foreigners in Distress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He made up his mind to leave these as a last resource, and
turning to the heading of Sweden and Norway looked out the
address of the consulate. He must go there the first thing the
next day, and get what advice and help he could. There was
also in Fleet Street a Scandinavian club; he would go there
and get a list of the members; it was possible that he might
meet with some familiar name, and at any rate he should hear
his own language spoken, which in itself would be a relief.
This arranged, he tried to sleep, but with little success; his
brain was too much overwrought with the terrible reversals of
fortune he had met with that day, with the sorrows that had
come to him, not as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“Single spies,</div>
      <div class='line'>But in battalions!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whenever he did for a few minutes sink into a doze, it was
only to be haunted by the most horrible dreams, and when
morning came he was ill and feverish, yet as determined as
before to go through with the programme he had marked out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Swedish minister received him very kindly, and listened
to as much of his story as would bear telling, with great patience.
“It is a very hard case,” he said. “The English firm perhaps
consulted their own pockets in making this new arrangement,
but to break off an old connection so suddenly, and as it
chanced at such a trying moment, was hard lines. What sort
of people are they, these Morgans? You have met them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes,” said Frithiof, coloring. “One of the brothers
was in Norway this summer, came to our house, dined with us,
professed the greatest friendliness, while all the time he must
have known what the firm was meditating.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Doubtless came to see how the land lay,” said the minister.
“And what of the other brother?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I saw him yesterday,” replied Frithiof. “He was very
civil; told me the telegram had been sent off that morning
about the affair, as it would not bear delay, and spoke very
highly of my father. Words cost nothing, you see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The consul noted the extreme bitterness of the tone, and
looked searchingly into the face of his visitor. “Poor fellow!”
he reflected; “he starts in life with a grievance, and there is
nothing so bad for a man as that. A fine, handsome boy, too.
If he stays eating his heart out in London he will go to the
dogs in no time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“See,” he said, “these Morgans, though they may be keen
business men, yet they are after all human. When they learn
at what an unlucky time their telegram arrived, it is but natural
that they should regret it. Their impulse will be to help you.
I should advise you to go to them at once and talk the affair
over with them. If they have any proper feeling they will offer
you some sort of employment in this new Stavanger branch, or
they might, perhaps, have some opening for you in their London
house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can not go to them,” said Frithiof, in a choked voice.
“I would rather die first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can understand,” said the consul, “that you feel very
bitter, and that you resent the way in which they have behaved.
But still I think you should try to get over that. After all,
they knew nothing of your father’s affairs; they did not intentionally
kill him. That the two disasters followed so closely
on each other was but an accident.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Still I could never accept anything from them; it is out of
the question,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Excuse me if I speak plainly,” said the consul. “You are
very young, and you know but little of the world. If you
allow yourself to be governed by pride of this sort you can not
hope to get on. Now turn it over in your mind, and if you
do not feel that you can see these people, at any rate write to
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot explain it all to you, sir,” said Frithiof. “But
there are private reasons which make that altogether impossible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The blood had mounted to his forehead, his lips had closed
in a straight line; perhaps it was because they quivered that
he compressed them so.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A woman in the question,” reflected the consul. “That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>complicates matters. All the more reason that he should leave
London.” Then, aloud: “If you feel unable to apply to them,
I should recommend you strongly to try America. Every one
flocks to London for work, but as a matter of fact London
streets just now are not paved with gold; everything is at a
standstill; go where you will, you will hear that trade is bad,
that employment is scarce, and that living is dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I could hear of any opening in America, I would go at
once,” said Frithiof. “But at Bergen we have heard of late
that it is no such easy thing even over there to meet with work.
I will not pay the expenses of the voyage merely to be in my
present state, and hundreds of miles further from home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What can you do?” asked the consul. “Is your English
pretty good?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can write and speak it easily. And, of course, German
too. I understand book-keeping.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Any taste for teaching?” asked the consul.</p>

<p class='c000'>“None,” said Frithiof decidedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the only thing that seems open to you is the work of
a secretary, or a clerkship, or perhaps you could manage translating,
but that is not easy work to get. Everything now is
overcrowded, so dreadfully overcrowded. However, of course
I shall bear you in mind, and you yourself will leave no stone unturned.
Stay, I might give you a letter of introduction to Herr
Sivertsen: he might possibly find you temporary work. He is
the author of that well-known book on Norway, you know.
Do you know your way about yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pretty well,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then there is his address—Museum Street. You had
better take an omnibus at the Bank. Any of the Oxford Street
ones will put you down at the corner, by Mudie’s. Let me
know how you get on: I shall be interested to hear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with a kindly shake of the hand, Frithiof found himself
dismissed; and somewhat cheered by the interview, he made
his way to the address which had been given him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Herr Sivertsen’s rooms were of the gloomiest: they reeked
of tobacco, they were ill-lighted, and it seemed to Frithiof that
the window could not have been opened for a week. An oblique
view of Mudie’s library was the only object of interest to
be seen without, though, by craning one’s neck, one could get
just a glimpse of the traffic in Oxford Street. He waited for
some minutes, wondering to himself how a successful author
could tolerate such a den, and trying to imagine from the room
what sort of being was the inhabiter thereof. At length the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>door opened, and a gray-haired man of five and fifty, with a
huge forehead and somewhat stern, square-jawed face, entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have read the consul’s letter,” he said, greeting Frithiof,
and motioning him to a chair. “You want what is very hard
to get. Are you aware that thousands of men are seeking employment
and are unable to meet with it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know it is hard,” said Frithiof. “Still I have more chance
here than in Norway, and anyhow I mean to get it.” The emphatic
way in which he uttered these last words made the author
look at him more attentively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am tired to death of young men coming to me and wanting
help,” he remarked frankly. “You are an altogether
degenerate race, you young men of this generation; in my
opinion you don’t know what work means. It’s money that
you want, not work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Frithiof dryly, “you are perfectly right. It is
money that I want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Herr Sivertsen had never before met with this honest
avowal. In reply to the speech which he had made to many
other applicants he had always received an eager protestation that
the speaker was devoted to work, that he was deeply interested
in languages, that Herr Sivertsen’s greatest hobbies were his hobbies
too. He liked this bold avowal in his secret heart, though
he had no intention of letting this be seen. “Just what I
said!” he exclaimed. “A pleasure-seeking, money-grubbing
generation. What is the result? I give work to be done, and
as long as you can get gold you don’t care how the thing is
scamped. Look here!” He took up a manuscript from the
table. “I have paid the fellow who did this. He is not only
behind time, but when at last the work is sent in it’s a miserable
performance, bungled, patched, scamped, even the handwriting
a disgrace to civilization. It’s because the man takes
no pride in the work itself, because he has not a spark of interest
in his subject. It just means to him so many shillings, that
is all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can at least write a clear hand,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That may be; but will you put any heart into your work?
Do you care for culture? for literature? Do you interest yourself
in progress? do you desire to help on your generation?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As far as I am concerned,” said Frithiof bitterly, “the
generation will have to take care of itself. As for literature, I
know little of it and care less; all I want is to make money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did I not tell you so?” roared Herr Sivertsen. “It is the
accursed gold which you are all seeking after. You care only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>for money to spend on your own selfish indulgences. You are
all alike! All! A worthless generation!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“However worthless, we unluckily have to live,” he said
coldly. “And as I can’t pretend to be interested in ‘culture,’
I must waste no more time in discussion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He bowed and made for the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stay,” said Herr Sivertsen: “it will do no harm if you
leave your address.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, but at present I have none to give,” said
Frithiof. “Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He felt very angry and very sore-hearted as he made his way
down Museum Street. To have met with such a rebuff from a
fellow-countryman seemed to him hard, specially in this time
of his trouble. He had not enough insight into character to
understand the eccentric old author, and he forgot that Herr
Sivertsen knew nothing of his circumstances. He was too abrupt,
too independent, perhaps also too refined to push his way
as an unknown foreigner in a huge metropolis. He was utterly
unable to draw a picturesque description of the plight he was
in, he could only rely on a sort of dogged perseverance, a fixed
resolve that he must and would find work; and in spite of
constant failures this never left him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tramped down to Vauxhall and began to search for lodgings,
looked at some half-dozen sets, and finally lighted on a
clean little house in a new-looking street a few hundred yards
from Vauxhall Station. There was a card up in the window
advertising rooms to let. He rang the bell and was a little
surprised to find the door opened to him by a middle-aged
woman who was unmistakably a lady, though her deeply lined
face told of privation and care, possibly also of ill-temper. He
asked the price of the rooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A sitting-room and bedroom at fifteen shillings a week,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is too much, and besides I only need one room,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am afraid we can not divide them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked disappointed. An idea seemed to strike the landlady.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a little room at the top you might have,” she said;
“but it would not be very comfortable. It would be only five
shillings a week, including attendance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Allow me to see it,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>He felt so tired and ill that if she had shown him a pig-sty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>he would probably have taken it merely for the sake of settling
matters. As it was, the room, though bare and comfortless,
was spotlessly clean, and, spite of her severe face, he rather
took to his landlady.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My things are at the Arundel Hotel,” he explained. “I
should want to come in at once. Does that suit you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes,” she said, scanning him closely. “Can you give
us any references?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can, if you wish, refer to the Swedish consul at 24
Great Winchester Street.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you are a Swede,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; I am a Norwegian, and have only been in London
since yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The landlady seemed satisfied, and having paid his five shillings
in advance, Frithiof went off to secure his portmanteau,
and by five o’clock was installed in his new home.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was well that he had lost no time in leaving his hotel, for
during the next two days he was unable to quit his bed, and
could only console himself with the reflection that at any rate
he had a cheap roof over his head and that his rent would not
ruin him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the cold night air from the river had given him a
chill on the previous night, or perhaps the strain of the excitement
and suffering had been too much for him. At any rate
he lay in feverish wretchedness, tossing through the long days
and weary nights, a misery to himself and an anxiety to the
people of the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>He discovered that his first impression had been correct.
Miss Turnour, the landlady, was well born; she and her two
sisters—all of them now middle-aged women—were the daughters
of a country gentleman, who had either wasted his substance
in speculation or on the turf. He was long since dead,
and had left behind him the fruits of his selfishness, three helpless
women, with no particular aptitudes and brought up to no
particular profession. They had sunk down and down in the
social scale, till it seemed that there was nothing left them but
a certain refinement of taste, which only enabled them to suffer
more keenly, and the family pedigree, of which they were
proud, clinging very much to the peculiar spelling of their
name, and struggling on in their little London house, quarreling
much among themselves, and yet firmly determined that
nothing on earth should part them. Frithiof dubbed them the
three Fates. He wondered sometimes whether, after long years
of poverty, he and Sigrid and Swanhild should come to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>same miserable condition, the same hopeless, cold, hard spirit,
the same pinched, worn faces, the same dreary, monotonous
lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three Fates did not take much notice of their lodger.
Miss Turnour often wished she had had the sense to see that
he was ill before admitting him. Miss Caroline, the youngest,
flatly declined waiting on him, as it was quite against her feelings
of propriety. Miss Charlotte, the middle one of the three,
who had more heart than the rest, tried to persuade him to see
a doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he replied, “I shall be all right in a day or two. It
is nothing but a feverish attack. I can’t afford doctor’s bills.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked at him a little compassionately; his poverty
touched a chord in her own life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps the illness has come in order that you may have
time to think,” she said timidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a very small little woman, like a white mouse, but
Frithiof had speedily found that she was the only one of the
three from whom he could expect any help. She was the
snubbed one of the family, partly because she was timid and
gentle, partly because she had lately adopted certain religious
views upon which the other two looked down with the most
supreme contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof was in no mood to respond to her well-meant efforts
to convert him, and used to listen to her discourses about the
last day with a stolid indifference which altogether baffled her.
It seemed as if nothing could possibly rouse him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah,” she would say, as she left the room with a sad little
shake of the head, “<em>I</em> shall be caught up at the second advent.
I’m not at all sure that <em>you</em> will be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The eldest Miss Turnour did not trouble herself at all about
his spiritual state; she thought only of the risk they were running
and the possible loss of money.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope he is not sickening with any infectious disease,” she
used to remark a dozen times a day.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Miss Charlotte said nothing, but silently thanked
Heaven that she had not been the one to accept the new
lodger.</p>

  <h2 id='XI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There is no suffering so severe as that which we perceive to
be the outcome of our own mistaken decision. Suffering caused
by our own sin is another matter; we feel in some measure
that we deserve it. But to have decided hastily, or too hopefully,
or while some false view of the case was presented to us,
and then to find that the decision brings grievous pain and sorrow,
this is cruelly hard.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was this consciousness of his own mistake which preyed
upon Frithiof’s mind as he tossed through those long solitary
hours. Had he only insisted on speaking to Blanche’s uncle
at Balholm, or on at once writing to her father, all might have
been well—his father yet alive, the bankruptcy averted, Blanche
his own. Over and over in his mind he revolved the things
that might have happened but for that fatal hopefulness which
had proved his ruin. He could not conceive now why he had
not insisted on returning to England with Blanche. It seemed
to him incredible that he had stayed in Norway merely to celebrate
his twenty-first birthday, or that he had been persuaded
not to return with the Morgans because Mr. Morgan would be
out of town till October. His sanguine nature had betrayed
him, just as his father had been betrayed by his too great hopefulness
as to the Iceland expedition. Certainly it is true that
sanguine people in particular have to buy their experience by
bitter pain and loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the Saturday morning he was almost himself again as far
as physical strength was concerned, and his mind was healthy
enough to turn resolutely away from these useless broodings
over the past, and to ask with a certain amount of interest.
“What is to be done next?” All is not lost when we are able
to ask ourselves that question; the mere asking stimulates us
to rise and be going, even though the direction we shall take
be utterly undecided.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Miss Charlotte came to inquire after her patient, she
found to her surprise that he was up and dressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” she exclaimed. “You are really well then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite well, thank you,” he replied, in the rather cold tone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of voice which had lately become habitual to him. “Have
you a newspaper in the house that you would be so good as to
lend me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly,” said Miss Charlotte, her face lighting up as she
hastened out of the room, returning in a minute with the special
organ of the religious party to which she belonged. “I think
this might interest you,” she began timidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t want to be interested,” said Frithiof dryly. “All
I want is to look through the advertisements. A thousand
thanks; but I see this paper is not quite what I need.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure that you know what you really need?”
she said earnestly, and with evident reference to a deeper
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had she not been such a genuine little woman, he would
have spoken the dry retort, “Madame, I need money,” which
trembled on his lips; but there was no suspicion of cant about
her, and he in spite of his bitterness still retained much of his
Norwegian courtesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see,” he said, smiling a little, “if I do not find work
I can not pay my rent, so I must lose no time in getting some
situation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The word “rent” recalled her eldest sister to Miss Charlotte’s
mind, and she resolved to say no more just at present as to
the other matters. She brought him one of the daily papers,
and with a little sigh of disappointment removed the religious
“weekly,” leaving Frithiof to his depressing study of the column
headed “Situations Vacant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Alas! how short it was compared to the one dedicated to
“Situations Wanted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an editor-reporter needed, who must be a “first-class
all-round man”; but Frithiof could not feel that he was
deserving of such epithets, and he could not even write shorthand.
There was a “gentleman needed for the canvassing and
publishing department of a weekly,” but he must be possessed
not only of energy but of experience. Agents were needed for
steel pens, toilet soap, and boys’ clothes, but no novices need
apply. Even the advertisement for billiard hands was qualified
by the two crushing words, “experienced only.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A correspondence clerk wanted” made him look hopefully
at the lines which followed, but unluckily a knowledge of Portuguese
was demanded as well as of French and German; while
the corn merchant who would receive a gentleman’s son in an
office of good position was prudent enough to add the words,
“No one need apply who is unable to pay substantial premium.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Out of the whole list there were only two situations for which
he could even inquire, and he soon found that for each of
these there were hundreds of applicants. At first his natural
hopefulness reasserted itself, and each morning he would set
out briskly, resolving to leave no stone unturned, but when
days and weeks had passed by in the monotonous search, his
heart began to fail him; he used to start from the little back
street in Vauxhall doggedly, dull despair eating at his heart,
and a sickening, ever-present consciousness that he was only
an insignificant unit struggling to find standing room in a
world where selfishness and money-grubbing reigned supreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each week brought him of course letters from Norway, his
uncle sent him letters of introduction to various London firms,
but each letter brought him only fresh disappointment. As
the consul had told him, the market was already overcrowded,
and though very possibly he might have met with work in the
previous summer when all was well with him, no one seemed
inclined to befriend this son of a bankrupt, with his bitter tone
and proud bearing; the impression he gave every one was that
he was an Ishmaelite with his hand against every man, and it
certainly did seem that at present every man’s hand was against
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>People write so much about the dangers of success and prosperity,
and the hardening effects of wealth, that they sometimes
forget the other side of the picture. Failure is always
supposed to make a man patient and humble and good; it rarely
does so, unless to begin with his spirit has been wakened
from sleep. The man whose faith has been a mere conventionality,
or the man who like Frithiof has professed to believe
in life, becomes inevitably bitter and hard when all things are
against him. It is just then when a man is hard and bitter, just
then when everything else has failed him, that the devil comes
to the fore offering pleasures which in happier times would have
had no attraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first certain aspects of London life had startled Frithiof;
but he speedily became accustomed to them; if he thought of
them at all it was with indifference rather than disgust. One
day however, he passed with seeming abruptness into a new
state of mind. Sick with disappointment after the failure of a
rather promising scheme suggested to him by one of the men
to whom his uncle had written, he walked through the crowded
streets too hopeless and wretched even to notice the direction
he had taken, and with a miserable perception that his last
good card was played, and that all hope of success was over.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>His future was an absolute blank, his present a keen distress,
his past too bright in contrast to bear thinking of.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, had he not been a fool to struggle so long against
his fate? Clearly every one was against him. He would fight
no longer; he would give up that notion—that high-flown,
unpractical notion of paying off his father’s debts. To gain an
honest living was apparently impossible, the world afforded
him no facilities for that, but it afforded him countless opportunities
of leading another sort of life. Why should he not
take what he could get? Life was miserable and worthless
enough, but at least he might put an end to the hideous monotony
of the search after work, at least he might plunge into a
phase of life which would have at any rate the charm of novelty.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was one of those autumn days when shadow and sun
alternate quickly; a gleam of sunshine now flooded the street
with brightness. It seemed to him that a gleam of light had
also broken the dreariness of his life. Possibly it might be a
fleeting pleasure, but why should he not seize upon it? His
nature, however, was not one to be hurried thoughtlessly into
vice. If he sinned he would do so deliberately. He looked
the two lives fairly in the face now, and in his heart he knew
which attracted him most. The discovery startled him. “The
pleasing veil which serves to hide self from itself” was suddenly
torn down, and he was seized with the sort of terror which
we most of us have experienced:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As that bright moment’s unexpected glare</div>
      <div class='line'>Shows us the best and worst of what we are.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Why not? why not?” urged the tempter. And the vague
shrinking seemed to grow less; nothing in heaven or earth
seemed real to him; he felt that nothing mattered a straw. As
well that way as any other. Why not?</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the critical moment of his life; just as in old pictures
one sees an angel and a devil struggling hard to turn the balance,
so now it seemed that his fate rested with the first influence
he happened to come across.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why should he not say, “Evil, be thou my good,” once and
for all, and have done with a fruitless struggle? That was the
thought which seethed in his mind as he slowly made his way
along the Strand, surely the least likely street in London where
one might expect that the good angel would find a chance of
turning the scale. The pushing crowd annoyed him; he paused
for a minute, adding another unit to the little cluster of men
which may always be seen before the window of a London picture-dealer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>He stopped less to look at the picture than for the
sake of being still and out of the hurrying tide. His eye wandered
from landscape to landscape with very faint interest until
suddenly he caught sight of a familiar view, which stirred his
heart strangely. It was a picture of the Romsdalshorn; he
knew it in an instant, with its strange and beautiful outline,
rising straight and sheer up into a wintry blue sky. A
thousand recollections came thronging back upon him, all the
details of a holiday month spent in that very neighborhood
with his father and Sigrid and Swanhild. He tried to drag
himself away, but he could not. Sigrid’s face kept rising before
him as if in protest against that “Why not?” which still
claimed a hearing within him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If she were here,” he thought to himself, “I might keep
straight. But that’s all over now, and I can’t bear this life any
longer. I have tried everything and have failed. And, after
all, who cares? It’s the way of the world. I shant be worse
than thousand of others.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Still the thought of Sigrid held him in check, the remembrance
of her clear blue eyes seemed to force him to go deeper
down beneath the surface of the sullen anger and disappointment
which were goading him on to an evil life. Was it after
all quite true? Had he really tried everything?</p>

<p class='c000'>Two or three times during his wanderings he had thought of
Roy Boniface, and had wondered whether he should seek him
out again; but in his trouble he had shrunk from going to
comparative strangers, and, as far as business went, it was
scarcely likely that Roy could help him. Besides, of the rest
of the family he knew nothing; for aught he knew the father
might be a vulgar, purse-proud tradesman—the last sort of man
to whom he could allow himself to be under any obligation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again came the horrible temptation, again that sort of terror
of his own nature. He turned once more to the picture of the
Romsdalshorn; it seemed to be the one thing which could witness
to him of truth and beauty and a life above the level of the
beasts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very slowly and gradually he began to see things as they
really were; he saw that if he yielded to this temptation he
could never again face Sigrid with a clear conscience. He
saw, too, that his only safeguard lay in something which would
take him out of himself. “I <em>will</em> get work,” he said, almost
fiercely. “For Sigrid’s sake I’ll have one more try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then all at once the evil imaginings faded, and there
rose up instead of them a picture of what might be in the future,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of a home he might make for Sigrid and Swanhild here in
London, where he now roamed about so wretchedly, of a life
which should in every way be a contrast to his present misery.
But he felt, as thousands have felt before him, that he was
handicapped in the struggle by his loneliness, and perhaps it
was this consciousness more than any expectation of finding
work which made him swallow his pride and turn his steps
toward Brixton.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By the time he reached Brixton it was quite dusk. Roy had
never actually given him his address; but he made inquiries at a
shop in the neighborhood, was offered the loan of a directory,
and having found what he needed was soon making his way up
the well-swept carriage-drive which led to Rowan Tree House.
He was tired with the walk and with his lonely day of wasted
work and disappointment. When he saw the outlines of the
big, substantial house looming out of the twilight he began to
wish that he had never come, for he thought to himself that it
would be within just such another house as the Morgans’, with
its hateful air of money, like the house of Miss Kilmansegg in
the poem:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Gold, and gold, and everywhere gold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To his surprise the door was suddenly flung open as he approached,
and a little boy in a velvet tunic came dancing out
on to the steps to meet him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Roy! Roy!” shouted the little fellow merrily, “I’ve come
to meet you!” Then speedily discovering his mistake, he
darted back into the doorway, hiding his face in Cecil’s
skirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood there with a little curly-headed child in her arms,
and her soft gray eyes and the deep blue baby eyes looked
searching out into the semi-darkness. Frithiof thought the
little group looked like a picture of the Holy Family. Somehow
he no longer dreaded the inside of the house. For the
first time for weeks he felt the sort of rest which is akin to
happiness as Cecil recognized him, and came forward with a
pretty eagerness of manner to greet him, too much astonished
at his sudden appearance for any thought of shyness to intervene.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We thought you must have gone back to Norway,” she exclaimed.
“I am so glad you have come to see us. The children
thought it was Roy who opened the gate. He will be
home directly. He will be so glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should have called before,” said Frithiof, “but my days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>have been very full, and then, too, I was not quite sure of your
address.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He followed her into the brightly lighted hall, and with a
sort of satisfaction shut out the damp November twilight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have so often spoken of you and your sisters,” said Cecil,
“but when Roy called at the Arundel and found that you had
left without giving any address, we thought you must have
gone back to Bergen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did he call on me again there?” said Frithiof. “I remember
now he promised that he would come, I ought to have thought
of it; but somehow all was confusion that night, and afterward
I was too ill.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must have been terrible for you all alone among strangers
in a foreign country,” said Cecil, the ready tears starting to
her eyes. “Come in and see my mother; she has often heard
how good you all were to us in Norway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She opened a door on the left of the entrance hall and took
him into one of the prettiest rooms he had ever seen: the soft
crimson carpet, the inlaid rosewood furniture, the bookshelves
with their rows of well-bound books, all seemed to belong to
each other, and a delightfully home-like feeling came over him
as he sat by the fire, answering Mrs. Boniface’s friendly inquiries;
he could almost have fancied himself once more in his
father’s study at Bergen—the room where so many of their long
winter evenings had been passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They sat there talking for a good half-hour before Roy and
his father returned, but to Frithiof the time seemed short
enough. He scarcely knew what it was that had such a charm
for him; their talk was not particularly brilliant, and yet it
somehow interested him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Boniface was one of those very natural, homely people
whose commonplace remarks have a sort of flavor of their own,
and Cecil had something of the same gift. She never tried to
make an impression, but went on her way so quietly, that it
was often not until she was gone that people realized what she
had been to them. Perhaps what really chased away Frithiof’s
gloom, and banished the look of the Ishmaelite from his face,
was the perception that these people really cared for him, that
their kindness was not labored formality but a genuine thing.
Tossed about for so long among hard-headed money-makers,
forced every day to confront glaring contrasts of poverty and
wealth, familiarized with the sight of every kind of evil, it was
this sort of thing that he needed.</p>

<p class='c000'>And surely it is strange that in these days when people are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>willing to devote so much time and trouble to good works, so
few are willing to make their own homes the havens of refuge
they might be. A home is apt to become either a mere place
of general entertainment, or else a selfishly guarded spot where
we may take our ease without a thought of those who are alone
in the world. Many will ask a man in Frithiof’s position to
an at-home or a dance, but very few care to take such a one
into their real home and make him one of themselves. They
will talk sadly about the temptations of town life, but they will
not in this matter stir an inch to counteract them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Boniface’s natural hospitality and goodness of heart
fitted her admirably for this particular form of kindness; moreover,
she knew that her daughter would prove a help and not
a hindrance, for she could in all things trust Cecil, who was
the sort of girl who can be friends with men without flirting
with them. At last the front door opened and footsteps sounded
in the hall; little Lance ran out to greet Mr. Boniface and Roy,
and Frithiof felt a sudden shame as he remembered the purse-proud
tradesman that foolish prejudice had conjured up in his
brain—a being wholly unlike the kindly, pleasant-looking man
who now shook hands with him, seeming in a moment to know
who he was and all about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so you have been in London all this time!” exclaimed
Roy. “Whereabouts are you staying?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Close to Vauxhall Station,” replied Frithiof. “Two or
three times I thought of looking you up, but there was always
so much to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have found work here, then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, indeed; I wish I had. It seems to me one may starve
in this place before finding anything to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen wishes to say good-night to you, Herr Falck,” said
Cecil, leading the little girl up to him; and the bitter look
died out of Frithiof’s face for a minute as he stooped to kiss
the baby mouth that was temptingly offered to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be hard if in all London we can not find you something,”
said Mr. Boniface. “What sort of work do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would do anything,” said Frithiof. “Sweep a crossing
if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They all laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many people say that vaguely,” said Mr. Boniface. “But
when one comes to practical details they draw back. The mud
and the broom look all very well in the distance, you see.”
Then as a bell was rung in the hall: “Let us have tea first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>and afterward, if you will come into my study we will talk the
matter over. We are old-fashioned people in this house, and
keep to the old custom of tea and supper. I don’t know how
you manage such things in Norway, but to my mind it seems
that the middle of the day is the time for the square meal, as
they say in America.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If the meal that awaited them in the dining-room was not
“square,” it was at any rate very tempting; from the fine
damask table cloth to the silver gypsy kettle, from the delicately
arranged chrysanthemums to the Crown Derby cups
and saucers, all bespoke a good taste and the personal supervision
of one who really cared for beauty and order. The
very food looked unlike ordinary food, the horseshoes of fancy
bread, the butter swan in its parsley-bordered lake, the honeycomb,
the cakes hot and cold, and the beautiful bunches of
grapes from the greenhouse, all seemed to have a sort of character
of their own. For the first time for weeks Frithiof felt
hungry. No more was said of the unappetizing subject of the
dearth of work, nor did they speak much of their Norwegian
recollections, because they knew it would be a sore subject
with him just now.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the way, Cecil,” remarked Mr. Boniface, when presently
a pause came in the general talk, “I saw one of your heroes
this morning. Do you go in for hero-worship in Norway,
Herr Falck? My daughter here is a pupil after Carlyle’s own
heart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We at any rate read Carlyle,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But who can it have been?” exclaimed Cecil. “Not
Signor Donati?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The very same,” said Mr. Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I thought he was singing at Paris?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So he is; he only ran over for a day or two on business,
and he happened to look in this morning with Sardoni, who
came to arrange about a song of his which we are going to
publish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sardoni seems to me the last sort of man one would expect
to write songs,” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But in spite of it he has written a very taking one,” said
Mr. Boniface, “and I am much mistaken if it does not make
a great hit. If so his fortune is made, for you see he can write
tenor songs for himself and contralto songs for his wife, and
they’ll get double royalties that way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But Signor Donati, father, what did he say? What is he
like?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Well, he is so unassuming and quiet that you would never
think it possible he’s the man every one is raving about. And,
except for that, he’s really very much like other people, talked
business very sensibly, and seemed as much interested about
this song of Sardoni’s as if there had never been anything
out of the way in his own life at all. I took to him very
much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t you get him to sing next summer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tried, but it is out of the question. He has signed an
agreement only to sing for Carrington. But he has promised
me to sing at one of our concerts the year after next.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fancy having to make one’s arrangements so long beforehand!”
exclaimed Cecil. “You must certainly hear him, Herr
Falck, when you have a chance; they say he is the finest baritone
in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He made us all laugh this morning,” said Mr. Boniface.
“I forget now what started it, something in the words of the
song, I fancy, but he began to tell us how yesterday he had
been down at some country place with a friend of his, and as
they were walking through the grounds they met a most comical
old fellow in a tall hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Halloo!’ exclaimed his friend, ‘here’s old Sykes the mole-catcher,
and I do declare he’s got another beaver! Where on
earth does he get them?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘In England,’ said Donati to his friend, ‘it would hardly
do to inquire after his hatter, I suppose.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“At which the other laughed of course, and they agreed together
that just for a joke they would find out. So they began
to talk to the old man, and presently the friend remarked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘I say, Sykes, my good fellow, I wish you’d tell me how
you manage to get such a succession of hats. Why, you are
rigged out quite fresh since I saw you on Monday.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The old mole-catcher gave a knowing wink, and after a
little humming and hawing he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Well, sir, yer see I changed clothes yesterday with a gentleman
in the middle of a field.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Changed clothes with a gentleman!’ they exclaimed.
‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the mole-catcher began to laugh outright, and leading
them to a gap in the hedge, pointed away into the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘There he be, sir; there he be,’ he said, laughing till he
almost choked. ‘It be naught but a scarecrow; but the scarecrows
they’ve kep’ me in clothes for many a year.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof broke out into a ringing boyish laugh; it was the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>time he had laughed for weeks. Cecil guessed as much, and
blessed Signor Donati for having been the cause; but as she
remembered what the young Norwegian had been only a few
months before, she could not help feeling sad—could not help
wondering what sorrow had changed him so terribly. Had
Blanche Morgan been faithful to him? she wondered. Or had
his change of fortune put an end to everything between them?
In any case he must greatly resent the way in which his father
had been treated by the English firm, and that alone must
make matters very difficult for the two lovers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Musing over it all, she became silent and abstracted, and on
returning to the drawing-room took up a newspaper, glancing
aimlessly down the columns, and wondering what her father
and Roy would advise Frithiof to do, and how the discussion
in the study was prospering.</p>

<p class='c000'>All at once her heart began to beat wildly, for she had
caught sight of some lines which threw a startling light on
Frithiof’s changed manner, lines which also revealed to her the
innermost recesses of her own heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The marriage arranged between Lord Romiaux and Miss
Blanche Morgan, only daughter of Austin Morgan, Esq., will
take place on the 30th instant, at Christ Church, Lancaster
Gate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was half-frightened at the sudden rage which took possession
of her, at the bitterness of the indignation which burned
in her heart. What right had Blanche Morgan to play with
men? to degrade love to a mere pastime? to make the most
sacred thing in the world the sport of a summer holiday? to
ruin men’s lives for her own amusement? to lure on a mere
boy and flatter and deceive him; then quietly to throw him
over?</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how about yourself?” said a voice in her heart. “Are
you quite free from what you blame in Blanche Morgan? Will
you not be tempted to hope that he may like you? Will you
not try to please him? Will it not be a pleasure to you if he
cares for your singing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All that is quite true,” she admitted. “I do care to please
him; I can’t help it; but oh, God! let me die rather than do
him harm!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her quiet life with the vague feeling of something wanting
in it had indeed been changed by the Norwegian holiday.
Now, for the first time, she realized that her uneventful girlhood
was over; she had become a woman, and, woman-like,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>she bravely accepted the pain which love had brought into her
life, and looked sadly, perhaps, yet unshrinkingly into the
future, where it was little likely that anything but grief and
anxiety awaited her. For she loved a man who was absolutely
indifferent to her, and her love had given her clear insight.
She saw that he was a man whose faith in love, both human
and divine, had been crushed out of him by a great wrong;
a man whose whole nature had deteriorated and would continue
to deteriorate, unless some unforeseen thing should interfere
to change his whole view of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the scalding tears which rose to her eyes were not tears
of self-pity; they were tears of sorrow for Frithiof, of disappointment
about his ruined life, of a sad humility as she thought
to herself: “Oh! if only I were fit to help him! If only!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile in the study a very matter-of-fact conversation
was being held.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What I want to find out,” said Mr. Boniface, “is whether
you are really in earnest in what you say about work. There
are thousands of young men saying exactly the same thing, but
when you take the trouble to go into their complaint you find
that the real cry is not ‘Give me work by which I can get an
honest living!’ but ‘Give me work that does not clash with
my tastes—work that I thoroughly like.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have no particular tastes,” said Frithiof coldly. “The
sort of work is quite indifferent to me as long as it will bring
in money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are really willing to begin at the bottom of the ladder
and work your way up? You are not above taking a step
which would place you much lower in the social scale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A fellow living on the charity of a relation who grudges
every farthing, as taking something away from his own children,
is not likely to trouble much about the social scale,” said
Frithiof bitterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. Then I will, at any rate, suggest my plan for
you, and see what you think of it. If you care to accept it
until something better turns up, I can give you a situation in
my house of business. Your salary to begin with would be but
small; the man who leaves me next Monday has had only five
and-twenty shillings a week, and I could not, without unfair
favoritism, give you more at first. But every man has a chance
of rising, and I am quite sure that you, with your advantages,
would do so. You understand that, as I said, it is mere work
that I am offering you. Doubtless standing behind a counter
will not be very congenial work to one brought up as you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>been; but you might do infinitely worse, and I can at least
promise you that you will be treated as a man—not, as in many
places you would find it, as a mere ‘hand.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Possibly, when he first arrived in London, Frithiof might
have scouted such a notion if it had been proposed to him,
but now his first question was whether he was really qualified
for the situation. Those hard words which had so often
confronted him—“Experienced only”—flashed into his
mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have had a good education,” he said, “and, of course,
understand book-keeping and so forth, but I have had no experience.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I quite understand that,” said Mr. Boniface. “But you
would soon get into the way of things. My son would show
you exactly what your work would be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course I would,” said Roy. “Think it over, Falck, for
at any rate it would keep you going for a time while you look
round for a better opening.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, there is no need to make up your mind to-night.
Sleep upon it, and let me know how you decide to-morrow. If
you think of accepting the situation, then come and see me in
Regent Street between half-past one and two o’clock. We
close at two on Saturdays. And in any case, whether you
accept or refuse this situation, I hope you will come and spend
Saturday to Monday with us here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very good,” said Frithiof, thinking to himself how
unlike these people were to any others he had come across in
London. Miss Charlotte Turnour had tried to do him good;
it was part of her creed to try to do good to people. The
Bonifaces, on the other hand, had simply been friendly and
hospitable to him, had shown him that they really cared for
him, that they were sorry for his sorrow, and anxious over his
anxieties. But from Rowan Tree House he went away with a
sense of warmth about the heart, and from Miss Charlotte he
invariably turned away hardened and disgusted. Perhaps it
was that she began at the wrong end, and, like so many people
in the world, offered the hard crust of dogmatic utterances to
one who was as yet only capable of being nourished on the real
substance of the loaf—a man who was dying for want of love,
and who no more needed elaborate theological schemes than
the starving man in the desert needs the elaborate courses of a
dinner-party.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is God’s way to reveal Himself through man, though we
are forever trying to improve upon His way, and endeavoring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>to convert others by articles of religion instead of the beauty
of holiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frithiof walked home to Vauxhall he felt more at rest
than he had done for many days. They had not preached at
him; they had not given him unasked-for advice; they had
merely given one of the best gifts that can be given in this
world, the sight of one of those homes where the kingdom of
heaven has begun—a home, that is, where “righteousness and
peace and joy” are the rule, and whatever contradicts this
reign of love the rare exception.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 id='XIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The gloomy little lodging-house felt desolate enough to him
as he unlocked the door with his latch-key and climbed the
creaking stairs to his sparsely furnished room. Evidently the
three Miss Turnours were having a very animated quarrel, for
their voices were pitched in that high key which indicates a
stormy atmosphere, and even their words reached him distinctly
as he passed by the bedroom which was the arena of
strife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, my dear Caroline—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t talk nonsense, my dear, you know perfectly well—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean to say, my dear—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder,” thought Frithiof, “whether they ever allow each
other to finish a sentence. It’s like the catch that they used to
sing at Balholm, about ‘Celia’s Charms.’ If any one ever writes
a catch called ‘The Quarrel,’ he must take care to stick in
plenty of ‘my dears!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strict economy in gas was practiced by the Miss Turnours,
and Frithiof had to grope about for matches. “Attendance,”
too, did not apparently include drawing down the blind, or
turning down the bed. The room looked most bare and comfortless,
and the dismal gray paper, with its oblong slabs, supposed
by courtesy to represent granite, was as depressing as
the dungeon of Giant Despair’s castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>To stay here with nothing to do—to fag through weary days
of disappointing search after work, and then to return to this
night after night, was but a sorry prospect. Would it not indeed
be well for him if he swallowed his pride and accepted this
offer of perfectly honorable work which had been made to
him? The idea was in many ways distasteful to him, and yet
dared he reject it?</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking honestly into his own mind he detected there something
that urged him to snatch at this first chance of work, lest,
with fresh failure and disappointment, the very desire for work
should die within him, and he should sink into a state which
his better nature abhorred. The clatter of tongues still ascended
from below. He took off his boots, dropping first one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and then the other with a resounding thud upon the floor, after
the manner of men. Then wondering whether consciousness
of his being within earshot would allay the storm, he threw
down both boots at once with a portentous noise outside his
room and shut and locked the door with emphasis. Still the
female battle continued. He threw himself down on the bed,
wondering what it was that made families so different. It was
not money which gave the tone to the Bonifaces’ house. The
Morgans were infinitely richer. It was not a great profession
of religion. The Miss Turnours were all ardently and disputatiously
religious. What was it?</p>

<p class='c000'>He fell asleep before he had solved the problem, and had an
odd, confused dream. He dreamed that he was climbing the
Romsdalshorn, and that darkness had overtaken him. Below
him was a sheer precipice, and he could hear the roar of
wild beasts as they wandered to and fro thirsting for his
blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are bound to get me sooner or later,” he thought,
“for I can never hold out till daylight. I may as well let
myself go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the thought of the horror of that fall was so great that
he almost woke with it. But something seemed to him to quiet
him again. It was partly curiosity to understand the meaning
of a light which had dawned in the sky, and which deepened
and spread every moment. At last he saw that it had been
caused by the opening of a door, and in the doorway, with a
glory of light all about them, he saw the Madonna and the
Holy Child. A path of light traced itself from them on the
mountain-side to the place where he stood, and he struggled
up, no longer afraid to go forward, and without a thought of
the beasts or the precipice. And thus struggling on, all details
were lost in a flood of light, and warmth, and perfect content,
and a welcome that left nothing wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'>A pushing back of chairs in the room below suddenly roused
him. With a sense of bewilderment, he found himself lying
on the hard lodging-house bed, and heard the quarrelsome
voices rising through the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Still at it,” he thought to himself with a bitter smile. And
then he thought of the picture of the Romsdalshorn he had
seen that afternoon—he remembered a horrible temptation that
had seized him—remembered Cecil standing in the open door
with the child in her arms, remembered the perfect welcome
he had received from the whole house. Should he in his foolish
pride drift into the miserable state of these poor Turnours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and drag through life in poverty, because he was too well-born
to take the work he could get?</p>

<p class='c000'>“These poor ladies would be happier even in service than
they are here, in what they call independence,” he reflected.
“I shall take this situation; it’s the first step up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning he went to the Swedish Embassy to ask
advice once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad to see you,” said the consul. “I was hoping you
would look in again, for I met old Sivertsen the other day,
and he was most anxious to have your address. He said you
went off in a hurry, and never gave him time to finish what he
was saying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He did nothing but inveigh against the rising generation,
and I didn’t care to waste the whole morning over that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have too little diplomacy about you,” said the consul.
“You do not make the best of your own case. However,
Sivertsen seems to have taken a fancy to you, and I advise
you to go to him again; he will most likely offer you work.
If I were you, I would make up my mind to take whatever
honest work turns up, and throw pride to the winds. Leave
your address here with me, and if I hear of anything I’ll let
you know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof, somewhat unwillingly, made his way to Museum
Street, and was ushered into the stuffy little den where Herr
Sivertsen sat smoking and writing serenely. He bowed stiffly,
but was startled to see the sudden change which came over the
face of the old Norwegian at sight of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So! You have come back, then!” he exclaimed, shaking
him warmly by the hand, just as though they had parted the
best of friends. “I am glad of it. Why didn’t you tell me
the real state of the case? Why didn’t you tell me you were
one of the victims of the accursed thirst for gold? Why
didn’t you tell me of the hardness and rapacity of the English
firm? But you are all alike—all! Young men nowadays can’t
put a decent sentence together; they clip their words as close
as if they were worth a mint of money. A worthless generation!
Sit down, now, sit down, and tell me what you can do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof, perceiving that what had first seemed like boorishness
was really eccentricity, took the proffered chair, and tried
to shake off the mantle of cold reserve which had of late
fallen upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I could do translating,” he replied. “English, German,
or Norwegian. I am willing to do copying; but there, I suppose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the typewriters would cut me out. Any way, I have four
hours to spare in the evening, and I want them filled.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have found some sort of work, then, already?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I have got work which will bring me in twenty-five shillings
a week, but it leaves me free from eight o’clock, and I
want evening employment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Herr Sivertsen gave a grunt which expressed encouragement
and approval. He began shuffling about masses of foolscap
and proofs which were strewn in wild confusion about the
writing-table. “These are the revised proofs of Scanbury’s
new book; take this page and let me see how you can render
it into Norwegian. Here are pen and paper. Sit down and
try your hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof obeyed. Herr Sivertsen seemed satisfied with the
result.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put the same page into German,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof worked away in silence, and the old author paced
to and fro with his pipe, giving a furtive glance now and then
at the down-bent head with its fair, obstinate hair brushed erect
in Norwegian fashion, and the fine Grecian profile upon which
the dark look of trouble sat strangely. In spite of the sarcasm
and bitterness which disappointment had roused in Frithiof’s
nature the old author saw that such traits were foreign to his
real character—that they were but a thin veneer, and that beneath
them lay the brave and noble nature of the hardy Norseman.
The consul’s account of his young countryman’s story
had moved him greatly, and he was determined now to do what
he could for him. He rang the bell and ordered the Norwegian
maid-servant to bring lunch for two, adding an emphatic
“<span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Strax!</span>” (immediately), which made Frithiof look up from
his writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have finished?” asked Herr Sivertsen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not quite. I can’t get this last bit quite to my mind. I
don’t believe there is an equivalent in German for that expression.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are quite right. There isn’t. I couldn’t get anything
for it myself. What have you put? Good! very good. It is
an improvement on what I had thought of. The sentence runs
better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took the paper from the table and mumbled through it
in an approving tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! you will do,” he said, at the end. “Now while we
lunch together we can discuss terms. Ha! what has she
brought us? Something that pretends to be German sausage!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Good heavens! The depravity of the age! <em>This</em> German
sausage indeed! I must apologize to you for having it on the
table, but servants are all alike nowadays—all alike! Not one
of them can understand how to do the marketing properly. A
worthless generation!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof began to be faintly amused by the old man, and as
he walked away from Museum Street with a week’s work under
his arm he felt in better spirits than he had done for some
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>With not a little curiosity he sought out the Bonifaces’ shop
in Regent Street. It had a well-ordered, prosperous look about
it: double doors kept the draught from those within, the place
was well warmed throughout; on each side of the door was a
counter with a desk and stool, Mr. Boniface being one of those
who consider that sitting is as cheap as standing, and the monotony
of the long shelves full of holland-covered portfolios
was broken by busts of Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner, and other
great musicians. The inner shop was consecrated to instruments
of all kinds, and through this Frithiof was taken to Mr.
Boniface’s private room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said the shop-owner, greeting him kindly. “And
have you made your decision!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, I have decided to accept the situation,” said
Frithiof. And something in his face and bearing showed
plainly that he was all the better for his choice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I forget whether I told you about the hours,” said Mr.
Boniface. “Half-past eight in the morning till half-past seven
at night, an hour out of that for dinner, and half an hour for tea.
You will have of course the usual bank holidays, and we also
arrange that each of our men shall have a fortnight some time
during the summer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very thoughtful for your hands,” said Frithiof.
“It is few, I should fancy, who would allow so much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know that,” said Mr. Boniface. “A good many, I
fancy, try something of the sort, and I am quite sure that it invariably
answers. It is not in human nature to go on forever
at one thing—every one needs variety. Business becomes a
tread-mill if you never get a thorough change, and I like my
people to put their heart into the work. If you try to do that
you will be of real value, and are bound to rise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look,” said Roy, showing him a neatly drawn-out plan of
names and dates. “This is the holiday chart which we worked
out this summer. It takes my father quite a long time to arrange
it all and make each dovetail properly with the others.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>They lingered for a few minutes talking over the details of
the business, then Roy took Frithiof down into the shop again,
and in the uninterrupted quiet of the Saturday afternoon
showed him exactly what his future work would be. He was
to preside at the song-counter, and Roy initiated him into the
arrangement of the brown-holland portfolios with their black
lettering, showed him his desk with account-books, order-book,
and cash-box, even made him practice rolling up music in the
neat white wrappers that lay ready to hand—a feat which at
first he did not manage very quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am afraid all this must be very uncongenial to you,”
said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps,” said Frithiof. “But it will do as well as anything
else. And indeed,” he added warmly, “one would put
up with a great deal for the sake of being under such a man
as Mr. Boniface.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The real secret of the success of the business is that he
personally looks after every detail,” said Roy. “All the men
he employs are fond of him; he expects them to do their best
for him, and he does his best for them. I think you may really
be happy enough here, though of course it is not at all the sort
of life you were brought up to expect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Each thought involuntarily of the first time they had met,
and of Blanche Morgan’s ill-timed speech: “Only a shopkeeper!”
Roy understood perfectly well what it was that
brought the bitter look into his companion’s face, and, thinking
that they had stayed long enough for Frithiof to get a pretty
clear idea of the work which lay before him on Monday morning,
he proposed that they should go home together. He had
long ago got over the selfish desire to be quit of the responsibility
of being with the Norwegian; his first awkward shyness
had been, after all, natural enough, for those whose lives have
been very uneventful seldom understand how to deal with
people in trouble, and are apt to shrink away in unsympathetic
silence because they have not learned from their own sore need
what it is that human nature craves for in sorrow. But each
time he met Frithiof now he felt that the terrible evening at
the Arundel had broken down the barriers which hitherto had
kept him from friendship with any one out of his own family.
Mere humanity had forced him to stay as the solitary witness
of an overwhelming grief, and he had gained in this way a
knowledge of life and a sympathy with Frithiof, of which he
had been quite incapable before.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began to know intuitively how things would strike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Frithiof, and as they went down to Brixton he prepared him
for what he shrewdly surmised would be the chief disagreeable
in his business life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think you heard,” he began “that there is another
partner in our firm—a cousin of my father’s—James Horner.
I dare say you will not come across him very much, but he is
fond of interfering now and then, and sometimes if my father
is away he gets fussy and annoying. He is not at all popular
in the shop, and I thought I would just warn you beforehand,
though of course you are not exactly expecting a bed of
roses.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have been hard to say exactly what Frithiof was
expecting; his whole life had been unstrung, and this new
beginning represented to him merely a certain amount of
monotonous work to the tune of five-and-twenty shillings
a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached Rowan Tree House they found a carriage
waiting at the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Talk of the angel and its wings appear,” said Roy. “The
Horners are calling here. What a nuisance!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof felt inclined to echo this sentiment when he found
himself in the pretty drawing-room once more and became
conscious of the presence of an overdressed woman and a
bumptious little man with mutton-chop whiskers and inquisitive
eyes, whose air of patronage would have been comical had
it not been galling to his Norwegian independence. Roy had
done well to prepare him, for nothing could have been so irritating
to his sensitive refinement as the bland self-satisfaction,
the innate vulgarity of James Horner. Mrs. Boniface and Cecil
greeted him pleasantly, and Mrs. Horner bowed her lofty bonnet
with dignity when he was introduced to her, and uttered a
platitude about the weather in an encouraging tone, which
speedily changed, however, when she discovered that he was
actually “one of the hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Bonifaces have no sense of what is fitting,” she said
afterward to her husband. “The idea of introducing one of
the shopmen to me! I never go into Loveday’s drawing-room
without longing to leave behind me a book on etiquette.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s a well-meaning soul,” said James Horner condescendingly.
“But countrified still, and unpolished. It’s strange
after so many years of London life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not strange at all,” retorted Mrs. Horner snappishly.
“She never tries to copy correct models, so how’s it likely her
manners should improve. I’m not at all partial to Cecil either.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>They’ll never make a stylish girl of her with their ridiculous
ideas about stays and all that. I’ll be bound her waist’s a
good five-and-twenty inches.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, well, my dear, I really don’t see much to find fault with
in Cecil.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I do,” said Mrs. Horner emphatically. “For all her
quietness there’s a deal of obstinacy about the girl. I should
like to know what she means to do with that criminal’s children
that she has foisted on the family! I detest people who are
always doing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</span></i> things like that; it’s all of a piece with their
fads about no stays and Jaeger’s woolen clothes. The old customs
are good enough for me, and I’m sure rather than let
myself grow as stout as Loveday I’d tight-lace night as well
as day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s not much of a figure, it’s true.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Figure, indeed!” echoed his wife. “A feather-bed tied
around with a string, that’s what she is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But she makes the house very comfortable, and always has
a good table,” said Mr. Horner reflectively.</p>

<p class='c000'>His wife tossed her head and flushed angrily, for she knew
quite well that while the Bonifaces spent no more on housekeeping
than she did, their meals were always more tempting,
more daintily arranged. She was somehow destitute of the
gift of devising nice little dinners, and could by no means compass
a pretty-looking supper.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems to me, you know,” said James Horner, “that we
go on year after year in a dull round of beef and mutton, mutton
and beef.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, really, Mr. H.,” she replied sharply, “if you want
me to feed you on game and all the delicacies of the season,
you must give me a little more cash, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never said that I wanted you to launch out into all the
delicacies of the season. Loveday doesn’t go in for anything
extravagant; but somehow one wearies of eternal beef and
mutton. I wish they’d invent another animal!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And till they do, I’ll thank you not to grumble, Mr. H.
If there’s one thing that seems to me downright unchristian it
is to grumble at things. Why, where’s that idiot of a coachman
driving us to? It’s half a mile further that way. He
really must leave us; I can’t stand having a servant one can’t
depend on. He has no brains at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She threw down the window and shouted a correction to the
coachman, but unluckily, in drawing in her head again, the
lofty bonnet came violently into contact with the roof of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>carriage. “Dear! what a bother!” she exclaimed. “There’s
my osprey crushed all to nothing!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Cecil would say it was a judgment on you,” said
James Horner, smiling. “Didn’t you hear what she was telling
us just now? they kill the parent birds by scores and leave
the young ones to die of starvation. It’s only in the breeding
season that they can get those feathers at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw! what do I care for a lot of silly little birds!” said
Mrs. Horner, passing her hand tenderly and anxiously over
the crushed bonnet. “I shall buy a fresh one on Monday, if
it’s only to spite that girl; she’s forever talking up some craze
about people or animals being hurt. It’s no affair of mine;
my motto is ‘Live and let live’; and don’t be forever ferreting
up grievances.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof breathed more freely when the Horners had left
Rowan Tree House, and indeed every one seemed to feel that
a weight had been removed, and a delightful sense of ease
took possession of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cousin Georgina will wear ospreys to the bitter end, I
prophesy,” said Roy. “You’ll never convince her that anything
she likes is really hard on others.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course, many people have worn them before they knew
of the cruelty,” said Cecil, “but afterward I can’t think how
they can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, people as a rule don’t really care about pain at a
distance,” said Frithiof. “Torture thousands of these herons
and egrets by a lingering death, and though people know it is
so they wont care; but take one person within hearing of their
cries, and that person will wonder how any human being can
be such a barbarian as to wear these so-called ospreys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose it is that we are so very slow to realize pain that
we don’t actually see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“People don’t really want to stop pain till it makes them
personally uncomfortable,” replied Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That sounds horribly selfish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Most things come round to selfishness when you trace
them out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you really quite think that? I don’t think it can be true,
because it is not of one’s self that one thinks in trying to do
away with the sufferings of the world; reformers always know
that they will have to endure a great deal of pain themselves,
and it is the thought of lessening it for others that makes them
brave enough to go on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you must allow,” said Frithiof, “that to get up a big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>subscription you must have a harrowing account of a catastrophe.
You must stir people’s hearts so that they wont be
comfortable again till they have given a guinea; it is their own
pain that prompts them to act—their own personal discomfort.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That may be, perhaps; but it is not altogether selfishness
if they really do give help; it must be a God-like thing that
makes them want to cure pain—a devil would gloat over it.
Why should you call it selfishness because the good pleases
them? ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le bien me plaît</span></i>’ was a good enough motto for the
Steadfast Prince, why not for the rest of us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But is it orthodox, surely, to do what you dislike doing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” struck in Roy, “like the nursery rhyme about</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The twelve Miss Pellicoes they say were always taught</div>
      <div class='line'>To do the thing they didn’t like, which means the thing they ought.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“But that seems to me exactly what is false,” said Cecil.
“Surely we have to grow into liking the right and the unselfish,
and hating the thing that only pleases the lower part of us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the growth is slow with most of us,” said Mr. Boniface.
“There’s a specimen for you,” and he glanced toward
the door, where an altercation was going on between Master
Lance and the nurse who had come to fetch him to bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, come, Lance, don’t make such a noise,” cried Cecil,
crossing the room and putting a stop to the sort of war-dance
of rage and passion which the little fellow was executing.
“Why, what do you think would happen to you if you were to
sit up late?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?” asked Lance, curiosity gaining the upper hand and
checking the frenzy of impatience which had possessed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You would be a wretched little cross white child, and
would never grow up into a strong man. Don’t you want to
grow big and strong so that you can take care of Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I’ll take care of you, too,” he said benevolently. “I’ll
take you all the way to Norway, and row you in a boat, and
shoot the bears.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The trouble generally is to find bears to shoot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, but Cecil did see where a bear had made its bed up
on Munkeggen, didn’t you, Cecil?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes, and you shall go with me some day,” she said,
hurrying the little fellow off because she thought the allusion
to Munkeggen would perhaps hurt Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy was on the point of taking up the thread of conversation
again about Norway, but she promptly intervened.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“I don’t know how we shall cure Lance of dancing with
rage like that; we have the same scene every night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You went the right way to work just now,” said Mr. Boniface.
“You made him understand why his own wishes must
be thwarted; and you see he was quite willing to believe what
you said. You had a living proof of what you were arguing—he
did what he had once disliked because he saw that it was
the road to something higher, and better, and more really desirable
than his play down here. In time he will have a sort
of respectful liking for the road which once he hated.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only drawback is,” said Frithiof, rather bitterly, “that
he may follow the road, and it may not lead him to what he expects;
he may go to bed like an angel, and yet, in spite of that,
lose his health, or grow up without a chance of taking you to
Norway or shooting bears.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, what then?” said Cecil quietly. “It will have led
him on in the right direction, and if he is disappointed of just
those particular things, why, he must look further and higher.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof thought of his dream and was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going to make tea, Roy,” said Mrs. Boniface, laying
down her netting, “and you had better show Herr Falck his
room. I hope you’ll often come and spend Sunday with us,”
she added, with a kindly glance at the Norwegian.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening they had music. Roy and Cecil both sung
well; their voices were not at all out of the common, but no
pains had been spared on their training, and Frithiof liked the
comfortable, informal way in which they sung one thing after
another, treating him entirely as one of the family.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And now it is your turn,” said Cecil, after awhile. “Father,
where is that Amati that somebody sent you on approval?
Perhaps Herr Falck would try it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, do you play the violin?” said Mr. Boniface; “that is
capital. You’ll find it in my study cupboard, Cecil; stay,
here’s the key.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof protested that he was utterly out of practice, that it
was weeks since he had touched his violin, which had been left
behind in Norway; but when he actually saw the Amati he
couldn’t resist it, and it ended in his playing to Cecil’s accompaniment
for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Cecil the hours seemed to fly, and Mrs. Boniface, after a
preliminary round of tidying up the room, came and stood by
her, watching her bright face with motherly contentment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Prayer time, darling,” she said, as the sonata came to an
end; “and since it’s Saturday night we mustn’t be late.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Ten o’clock already?” she exclaimed; “I had no idea it
was so late! What hymn will you have, father?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Evening Hymn,” said Mr. Boniface; and Frithiof,
wondering a little what was going to happen, obediently took
the place assigned him, saw with some astonishment that four
white-capped maid-servants had come into the drawing-room
and were sitting near the piano, and that Mr. Boniface was
turning over the leaves of a big Bible. He had a dim recollection
of having read something in an English poem about a
similar custom, and racked his brain to remember what it
could be until the words of a familiar psalm broke the stillness
of the room, and recalled him to the present.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh
my help,” read Mr. Boniface. And as he went on, the beautiful
old poem with its tender, reassuring cadences somehow
touched Frithiof, so that when they stood up to sing “Glory to
Thee, my God, this night,” he did not cavil at each line as he
would have done a little while before, but stood listening reverently,
conscious of a vague desire for something in which he
felt himself to be lacking. After all, the old beliefs which he
had dismissed so lightly from his mind were not without a
power and a beauty of their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I could be like these people,” he thought to himself,
kneeling for the first time for years.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though he did not hear a word of the prayer, and could
not honestly have joined in it if he had heard, his mind was
full of a longing which he could not explain. The fact was
that in the past he had troubled himself very little about the
matter, he had allowed the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitgeist</span>” to drive him as it
would, and following the fashion of his companions, with a
comfortable consciousness of having plenty to keep him
in countenance, he had thrown off the old faiths.</p>

<p class='c000'>He owned as much to Cecil the next day when, after breakfast,
they chanced to be alone together for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you found any Norwegian service in London, or will
you come with us?” she asked unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” he replied, “I gave up that sort of thing long ago,
and while you are out I will get on with some translation I
have in hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I beg your pardon,” she said, coloring crimson; “I had no
idea, or I should not have asked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was not the faintest shade of annoyance in Frithiof’s
face; he seemed puzzled at her confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The services bored me so,” he explained. He did not add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>as he had done to Blanche that in his opinion religion was only
fit for women, perhaps because it would have been difficult to
make such a speech to Cecil, or perhaps because the recollection
of the previous evening still lingered with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” said Cecil, smiling as she recognized the boyishness
of his remark; “I suppose every one goes through a stage of
being bored. Roy used to hate Sunday when he was little;
he used to have a Sunday pain which came on quite regularly
when we were starting to chapel, so that he could stay at
home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know you will all think me a shocking sinner to stay at
home translating this book,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, we shant,” said Cecil quietly. “If you thought it
was right to go to church of course you would go. You look
at things differently.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a little startled by her liberality.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You assume by that that I always do what I know to be
right,” he said, smiling. “What makes you suppose any such
thing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t tell you exactly; but don’t you think one has a
sort of instinct as to people? without really having heard anything
about them, one can often know that they are good
or bad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think one is often horribly mistaken in people,” said
Frithiof moodily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; sometimes one gets unfairly prejudiced, perhaps, by
a mere likeness to another person whom one dislikes. Oh, I
quite allow that this sort of instinct is not infallible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are much more liable to think too well of people than
not well enough,” said Frithiof. “You are a woman and have
seen but little of the world. Wait till you have been utterly
deceived in some one, and then your eyes will be opened, and
you will see that most people are at heart mean and selfish and
contemptible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But there is one thing that opens one’s eyes to see what is
good in people,” said Cecil. “You can’t love all humanity and
yet think them mean and contemptible, you soon see that they
are worth a great deal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is as you said just now,” said Frithiof, after a minute’s
silence, “we look at things differently. You look at the world
out of charitable eyes. I look at it seeing its baseness and
despising it. Some day you will see that my view is correct;
you will find that your kindly judgments are wrong. Perhaps
I shall be the first to undeceive you, for you are utterly wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>about me. You think me good, but it is ten to one that I go
to the bad altogether; after all, it would be the easiest way
and the most amusing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had gone on speaking recklessly, but Cecil felt much too
keenly to be checked by any conventionality as to the duty of
talking only of surface matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are unjust to the world, yourself included!” she
exclaimed. “I believe that you have too much of the hardy
Norseman about you ever to hanker after a life of ease and
pleasure which must really ruin you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That speech only shows that you have formed too high an
estimate of our national character,” said Frithiof. “Perhaps
you don’t know that the Norwegians are often drunkards?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Possibly; and so are the English; but, in spite of that, is
not the real national character true and noble and full of a
sense of duty? What I meant about you was that I think you
do try to do the things you see to be right. I never thought
you were perfect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then if I do the things that I see to be right I can only
see a very little, that’s certain,” he said lightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly so,” she replied, unable to help laughing a little at
his tone. “And I think that you have been too lazy to take
the trouble to try and see more. However, that brings us
round again to the things that bore you. Would you like to
write at this table in the window? You will be quite quiet in
here till dinner-time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She found him pens and ink, tore a soiled sheet off the blotting-pad,
drew up the blind so as to let in just enough sunshine,
and then left him to his translating.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a strange girl she is,” he thought to himself. “As
frank and outspoken as a boy, and yet with all sorts of little
tender touches about her. Sigrid would like her; they did
take to one another at Balholm, I remember.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with a bitter recollection of one who had eclipsed all
others during that happy week on the Sogne Fjord, the hard
look came back to his face, and taking up his pen he began to
work doggedly at Herr Sivertsen’s manuscript.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning his new life began: he turned his back on
the past and deliberately made his downward step on the social
ladder, which nevertheless meant an upward step on the ladder
of honesty and success. Still there was no denying that
the loss of position chafed him sorely; he detested having to
treat such a man as James Horner as his master and employer;
he resented the free-and-easy tone of the other men employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>on the premises. Mr. Horner, who was the sort of man who
would have patronized an archangel for the sake of showing off
his own superior affability, unluckily chanced to be in the shop
a good deal during that first week, and the new hand received
a large share of his notice. Frithiof’s native courtesy bore him
up through a good deal, but at last his pride got the better of
him, and he made it so perfectly apparent to the bumptious
little man that he desired to have as little to do with him as
possible, that James Horner’s bland patronage speedily changed
to active dislike.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What induced you to choose that Falck in Smith’s place?”
he said to Mr. Boniface, in a grumbling tone. He persisted
in dropping the broad “a” in Frithiof’s name, and pronouncing
it as if it rhymed with “talc”—a sound peculiarly offensive
to Norwegian ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is a friend of Roy’s,” was the reply. “What is it that
you dislike about him? He seems to me likely to prove very
efficient.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes; he has his wits about him, perhaps rather too
much so, but I can’t stand the ridiculous airs the fellow gives
himself. Order him to do anything, and he’ll do it as haughtily
as though he were master and I servant; and as for treating
him in a friendly way it’s impossible; he’s as stand-offish as if
he were a Crœsus instead of a poor beggar without a penny to
bless himself with.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is a very reserved fellow,” said Mr. Boniface; “and
you must remember that this work is probably distasteful to
him. You see he has been accustomed to a very different
position.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, his father was nothing but a fish merchant who went
bankrupt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But out in Norway merchants rank much more highly than
with us. Besides, the Falcks are of a very old family.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, really I never expected to hear such a radical as you
speak up for old family and all that nonsense,” said James
Horner. “But I see you are determined to befriend this fellow,
so it’s no good my saying anything against it. I hope you may
find him all you expect. For my part I consider him a most
unpromising young man; there’s an aggressiveness about his
face and bearing that I don’t like at all. A dangerous, headstrong
sort of character, and not in the least fit for the position
you have given him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which sweeping condemnation Mr. Horner left the
room, and Roy, who had kept a politic silence throughout the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>scene, threw down his pen and went into a subdued fit of
laughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You should see them together, father, it’s as good as a
play,” he exclaimed. “Falck puts on his grand air and is
crushingly polite the moment Cousin James puts in an appearance,
and that nettles him and he becomes more and more
vulgar and fussy, and so they go poking each other up worse
and worse every minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s very foolish of Falck,” said Mr. Boniface. “If he
means to get on in life, he will have to learn the art of rising
above such paltry annoyances as airs of patronage and manners
that jar on him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, down below in the shop, Frithiof had forgotten
his last encounter with James Horner, and as he set things in
order for the Saturday afternoon closing, his thoughts were far
away. He sorted music and took down one portfolio after
another mechanically, while all the time it seemed to him that
he was wandering with Blanche through the sweet-scented
pine woods, hearing her fresh, clear voice, looking into the
lovely eyes which had stolen his heart. The instant two
o’clock sounded the hour of his release, he snatched up
his hat and hurried away; his dreams of the past had taken
so strong a hold upon him that he felt he must try for at
least one more sight of the face that haunted him so persistently.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had touched no food since early morning, but he could
no more have eaten at that moment than have turned aside in
some other direction. Feeling as though some power outside
himself were drawing him onward, he followed with scarcely a
thought of the actual way, until he found himself within sight
of the Lancaster Gate House. A striped red and white awning
had been erected over the steps, he caught sight of it through
the trees, and his heart seemed to stand still. Hastily crossing
the wide road leading to the church, he gained a better view
of the pavement in front of Mr. Morgan’s house; dirty little
street children with eager faces were clustered about the railings,
and nurse-maids with perambulators flanked the red felt
which made a pathway to the carriage standing before the
door. He turned sick and giddy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fine doings there, sir,” remarked the crossing-sweeper,
who was still sweeping up the autumn leaves just as he had
been doing when Frithiof had passed him after his interview
with Blanche. “They say the bride’s an heiress and a beauty
too. Well, well, it’s an unequal world!” and the old man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>stopped to indulge in a paroxysm of coughing, then held out a
trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Got a copper about you, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof, just because the old man made that remark about
an unequal world, dropped a sixpence into the outstretched
palm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless you, sir!” said the crossing-sweeper, beginning
to sweep up the fallen leaves with more spirit than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Violets, sir, sweet violets?” cried a girl, whose eye had
caught the gleam of the silver coin.</p>

<p class='c000'>She held the basket toward him, but he shook his head and
walked hurriedly away toward the church. Yet the incident
never left his memory, and to the end of his life the scent of
violets was hateful to him. Like one in a nightmare, he reached
the church door. The organ was crashing out a jubilant
march; there was a sort of subdued hum of eager anticipation
from the crowd of spectators.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you a friend of the bride, sir?” asked an official.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he said icily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the side aisle, if you please, sir. The middle aisle is
reserved for friends only.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He quietly took the place assigned him and waited. It did
not seem real to him, the crowded church, the whispering
people; all that seemed real was the horrible sense of expectation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it will be well worth seeing,” remarked a woman, who
sat beside him, to her companion. “They always manages
things well in this place. The last time I come it was to see Lady
Graham’s funeral. Lor’! it was jest beautiful! After all,
there aint nothing that comes up to a real good funeral. It’s
so movin’ to the feelin’s, aint it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>An icy numbness crept over him, a most appalling feeling of
isolation. “This is like dying,” he thought to himself. And
then, because the congregation stood up, he too dragged himself
to his feet. The march had changed to a hymn. White-robed
choristers walked slowly up the middle aisle; their
words reached him distinctly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Still in the pure espousal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Christian man and maid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then suddenly he caught sight of the face which had more
than once been pressed to his, of the eyes which had lured him
on so cruelly. It was only for a moment. She passed by with
her attendant bride-maids, and black darkness seemed to fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>upon him, though he stood there outwardly calm, just like an
indifferent spectator.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you see her?” exclaimed his neighbor. “My! aint
she jest pretty! Satin dress, aint it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, bless your heart! not satin,” replied the other.
“’Twas brocade, and a guinea a yard, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet through all the whispering and the subdued noise of the
great congregation he could hear Blanche’s clear voice. “I will
always trust you,” she had said to him on Munkeggen. Now
he heard her answer “I will” to another question.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that, prayers and hymns seemed all mixed up in a wild
confusion. Now and then, between the heads of the crowd,
he caught a vision of a slim, white-robed figure, and presently
Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March” was struck up, and he knew
that she would pass down the aisle once more. Would her
face be turned in his direction? Yes; for a little child scattered
flowers before her, and she glanced round at it with a
happy, satisfied smile. As for Frithiof, he just stood there
passively, and no one watching him could have known of the
fierce anguish that wrung his heart. As a matter of fact,
nobody observed him at all; he was a mere unit in the crowd;
and with human beings all round him, yet in absolute loneliness,
he passed out of the church into the chill autumnal air, to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“Take up his burden of life again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saying only, ‘It might have been.’”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<p class='c007'>The cemetery just outside the Stadsport at Bergen, which
had called forth the eager admiration of Blanche Morgan in
the previous summer, looked perhaps even lovelier now that
winter had come with its soft, white shroud. The trees, instead
of their green leaves, stretched out rime-laden branches against
the clear, frosty sky; the crosses on the graves were fringed
with icicles, which, touched here and there by the lovely rays
of the setting sun, shone ruby-red, or in the shade gleamed
clear as diamonds against the background of crisp white snow.
Away in the distance Ulriken reared his grand old head
majestically, a dark streak of precipitous rock showing out now
and then through the veil which hid his summer face; and to
the right, in the valley, the pretty Lungegaarsvand was one
great sheet of ice, over which skaters glided merrily.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>The body of Sigurd Falck rested beside that of his wife in
the midst of all this loveliness, and one winter afternoon Sigrid
and little Swanhild came to bring to the grave their wreaths
and crosses, for it was their father’s birthday. They had
walked from their uncle’s house laden with all the flowers they
had been able to collect, and now stood at the gate of the
cemetery, which opened stiffly, owing to the frost. Sigrid
looked older and even sadder than she had done in the first
shock of her father’s death, but little Swanhild had just the
same fair rosy face as before, and there was a veiled excitement
and eagerness in her manner as she pushed at the
cemetery gate; she was able to take a sort of pleasure in bringing
these birthday gifts, and even had in her heart a keen
satisfaction in the certainty that “their grave” would look
prettier than any of the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No one else has remembered his birthday,” she said, as
they entered the silent graveyard. “See, the snow is quite
untrodden. Sigrid when are they going to put father’s name
on the stone?” and she pointed to the slanting marble slab
which leaned against the small cross. “There is only mother’s
name still. Wont they put a bigger slab instead where there
will be room for both?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not now,” said Sigrid, her voice trembling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But why not, Sigrid? Every one else has names put. It
seems as if we had forgotten him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no, no,” said Sigrid, with a sob. “It isn’t that, darling;
it is that we remember so well, and know what he would
have wished about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t understand,” said the child wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is in this way,” said Sigrid, taking her hand tenderly. “I
can not have money spent on the tombstone, because he would
not have liked it. Oh, Swanhild!—you must know it some
day, you shall hear it now—it was not only his own money that
was lost, it was the money of other people. And till it is paid
back how can I alter this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild’s eyes grew large and bright.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was that, then, that made him die,” she faltered. “He
would be so sorry for the other people. Oh, Sigrid, I will be
so good: I don’t think I shall ever be naughty again. Why
didn’t you tell me before, and then I shouldn’t have been cross
because you wouldn’t buy me things?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wanted to shield you and keep you from knowing,” said
Sigrid. “But after all, it is better that you should hear it from
me than from some outsider.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“You will treat me like a baby, Sigrid, and I’m ten years
old after all—quite old enough to be told things.... And
oh, you’ll let me help to earn money and pay back the people,
wont you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is what Frithiof is trying to do,” said Sigrid, “but it
is so difficult and so slow. And I can’t think of anything we
can do to help.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor dear old Frithiof,” said Swanhild. And she gazed
over the frozen lake to the snow mountains which bounded the
view, as if she would like to see right through them into the
big London shop where, behind a counter, there stood a fair-haired
Norseman toiling bravely to pay off those debts of
which she had just heard. “Why, on father’s last two birthdays
Frithiof was away in Germany, but then we were looking
forward so to having him home again. There’s nothing to look
forward to now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid could not reply, for she felt choked. She stood sadly
watching the child as she bent down, partly to hide her tears,
partly to replace a flower which had slipped out of one of the
wreaths. It was just that sense of having nothing to look forward
to which had weighed so heavily on Sigrid herself all
these months; she had passed very bravely through all the
troubles as long as there had been anything to do; but now
that all the arrangements were made, the villa in Kalvedalen
sold, the furniture disposed of, the new home in her uncle’s
house grown familiar, her courage almost failed her, and each
day she realized more bitterly how desolate and forlorn was
their position. The first sympathetic kindness of her aunt and
cousins had, moreover, had time to fade a little, and she became
growingly conscious that their adoption into the Grönvold
family was an inconvenience. The house was comfortable
but not too large, and the two sisters occupied the only spare
room, so that it was no longer possible to have visitors. The
income was fairly good, but times were hard, and even before
their arrival Fru Grönvold had begun to practice a few little
economies, which increased during the winter, and became
more apparent to all the family. This was depressing enough:
and then, as Swanhild had said, there was nothing to which
she could look forward, for Frithiof’s prospects seemed to her
altogether blighted, and she foresaw that all he was likely to
earn for some time to come would only suffice to keep himself,
and could by no possibility support three people. Very sadly
she left the cemetery, pausing again to struggle with the stiff
gate, while Swanhild held the empty flower-baskets.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Can’t you do it?” exclaimed the child. “What a tiresome
gate it is! worse to fasten than to unfasten. But see! here
come the Lundgrens. They will help.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid glanced round, blushing vividly as she met the eager
eyes of Torvald Lundgren, one of Frithiof’s school friends.
The greetings were frank and friendly on both sides, and
Madale, a tall, pretty girl of sixteen, with her hair braided into
one long, thick plait, took little Swanhild’s arm and walked on
with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us leave those two to settle the gate between them,”
she said, smiling. “It is far too cold to wait for them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Torvald Lundgren was a year or two older than Frithiof,
and having long been in a position of authority he was unusually
old for his age. As a friend Sigrid liked him, but of late she
had half-feared that he wished to be more than a friend, and
consequently she was not well pleased to see that, by the time
the gate was actually shut, Madale and Swanhild were far in advance
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you heard from Frithiof yet?” she asked, walking on
briskly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Torvald. “Pray scold him well for me when you
next write. How does he seem? In better spirits again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” said Sigrid; “even to me he writes very
seldom. It is wretched having him so far away and not knowing
what is happening to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish there was anything I could do for him,” said Torvald;
“but there seems no chance of any opening out here
for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is what my uncle says. Yet it was no fault of Frithiof’s:
it seems hard that he should have to suffer. I think the world
is very cruel. You and Madale were almost the only friends
who stood by us; you were almost the only ones who scattered
fir branches in the road on the morning of my father’s funeral.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You noticed that?” he said, coloring.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; when I saw how little had been strewn, I felt hurt and
sore to think that the others had shown so little respect for him,
and grateful to you and Madale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” he said quietly, “why will you not let me be
something more to you than a friend? All that I have is yours.
You are not happy in Herr Grönvold’s house. Let me take
care of you. Come and make my house happy, and bring
Swanhild with you to be my little sister.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Torvald!” she cried, “I wish you had not asked me
that. You are so good and kind, but—but—”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Do not answer me just yet, then; take time to think it
over,” he pleaded; “indeed I would do my best to make you
very happy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know you would,” she replied, her eyes filling with tears.
“But yet it could never be. I could never love you as a wife
should love her husband, and I am much too fond of you,
Torvald, to let you be married just for your comfortable house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your aunt led me to expect that, perhaps, in time, after
your first grief had passed—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it was very wrong of her,” said Sigrid hotly. “You
have always been my friend—a sort of second brother to me—and
oh, do let it be so still. Don’t leave off being my friend
because of this, for indeed I can not help it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My only wish is to help you,” he said sadly; “it shall
be as you would have it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then they walked on together in an uncomfortable silence
until they overtook the others at Herr Grönvold’s gate,
where Torvald grasped her hand for a moment, then, looking
at his watch, hurried Madale away, saying that he should be
late for some appointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fru Grönvold had unluckily been looking out of the window
and had seen the little group outside. She opened the front
door as the two girls climbed the steps.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did not the Lundgrens come in?” she asked, a look
of annoyance passing over her thin, worn face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t ask them,” said Sigrid, blushing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I think Torvald had some engagement,” said Swanhild,
unconsciously coming to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have been out a long time, Swanhild; now run away
to your practicing,” said Fru Grönvold, in the tone which the
child detested. “Come in here, Sigrid, I want a word with
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fru Grönvold had the best of hearts, but her manner was
unfortunate; from sheer anxiety to do well by people she
often repulsed them. To Sigrid, accustomed from her earliest
girlhood to come and go as she pleased and to manage her
father’s house, this manner was almost intolerable. She resented
interference most strongly, and was far too young and
inexperienced to see, beneath her aunt’s dictatorial tone, the
real kindness that existed. Her blue eyes looked defiant as
she marched into the sitting-room, and drawing off her gloves
began to warm her hands by the stove.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did you not ask Torvald Lundgren to come in?” asked
Fru Grönvold, taking up her knitting.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Because I didn’t want to ask him, auntie.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you ought to think what other people want, not always
of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did,” said Sigrid quickly. “I knew he didn’t want to
come in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What nonsense you talk, child!” said Fru Grönvold, knitting
with more vigor than before, as if she vented her impatience
upon the sock she was making. “You must know quite well
that Torvald admires you very much; it is mere affectation to
pretend not to see what is patent to all the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not pretend,” said Sigrid angrily, “but you—you have
encouraged him to hope, and it is unfair and unkind of you.
He told me you had spoken to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! he has proposed to you?” said Fru Grönvold, dropping
her work. “Did he speak to you to-day, dear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Sigrid, blushing crimson.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you said you would let him have his answer later on.
I see, dear, I see. Of course you could not ask him in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I said nothing of the sort,” said Sigrid vehemently. “I
told him that I could never think of marrying him, and we
shall still be the good friends we have always been.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear child,” cried Fru Grönvold, with genuine distress
in her tone, “how could you be so foolish, so blind to all
your own interests? He is a most excellent fellow, good and
steady and rich—all that heart could wish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There I don’t agree with you,” said Sigrid perversely. “I
should wish my husband to be very different. He is just like
Torvald in Ibsen’s ‘<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Et Dukkehjem</span>,’ we always told him so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pray don’t quote that hateful play to me,” said Fru Grönvold.
“Every one knows that Ibsen’s foolish ideas about
women being equal to men and sharing their confidence could
only bring misery and mischief. Torvald Lundgren is a good,
upright, honorable man, and your refusing him is most foolish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is very good, I quite admit,” said Sigrid. “He is my
friend, and has been always, and will be always. But if he were
the only man on earth nothing would induce me to marry him.
It would only mean wretchedness for us both.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, pray don’t put your foolish notions about equality and
ideal love into Karen’s head,” said Fru Grönvold sharply.
“Since you are so stupid and unpractical it will be well that
Karen should accept the first good offer she receives.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are not likely to discuss the matter,” said Sigrid, and
rising to her feet she hurriedly left the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upstairs she ran, choking with angry tears, her aunt’s last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>words haunting her persistently and inflicting deeper wounds
the more she dwelt upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She wants me to marry him so that she may be rid of the
expense of keeping us,” thought the poor girl. “She doesn’t
really care for us a bit, for all the time she is grudging the
money we cost her. But I wont be such a bad friend to poor
Torvald as to marry him because I am miserable here. I would
rather starve than do that. Oh! how I hate her maxims about
taking what you can get! Why should love and equality and a
true union lead to misery and mischief? It is the injustice of
lowering woman into a mere pleasant housekeeper that brings
half the pain of the world, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But by the time Sigrid had lived through the long evening,
bearing, as best she might, the consciousness of her aunt’s disappointment
and vexation with her, another thought had begun
to stir in her heart. And when that night she went to her room
her tears were no longer the tears of anger, but of a miserable
loneliness and desolation.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked at little Swanhild lying fast asleep, and wondered
how the refusal would affect her life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After all,” she thought to herself, “Swanhild would have
been happier had I accepted him. She would have had a much
nicer home, and Torvald would never have let her feel that she
was a burden. He would have been very kind to us both, and
I suppose I might have made him happy—as happy as he would
ever have expected to be. And I might have been able to help
Frithiof, for we should have been rich. Perhaps I am losing
this chance of what would be best for every one else just for a
fancy. Oh, what am I to do? After all, he would have been
very kind, and here they are not really kind. He would have
taken such care of me, and it would surely be very nice to be
taken care of again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then she began to think of her aunt’s words, and to wonder
whether there might not be some truth in them, so that by
the time the next day had dawned she had worried herself into
a state of confusion, and had Torvald Lundgren approached
her again might really have accepted him from some puzzle-headed
notion of the duty of being practical and always considering
others before yourself. Fortunately Torvald did not
appear, and later in the morning she took her perplexities to
dear old Fru Askevold, the pastor’s wife, who having worked
early and late for her ten children, now toiled for as many
grandchildren, and into the bargain was ready to be the friend
of any girl who chose to seek her out. In spite of her sixty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>years she had a bright, fresh-colored face, with a look of youth
about it which contrasted curiously with her snowy hair. She
was little, and plump and had a brisk, cheerful way of moving
about which somehow recalled to one—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The bird that comes about our doors</div>
      <div class='line'>When autumn winds are sobbing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Peter of Norway boors,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Now that is charming of you to come and see me just at
the very right minute, Sigrid,” said Fru Askevold, kissing the
girl, whose face, owing to trouble and sleeplessness, looked more
worn than her own. “I’ve just been cutting out Ingeborg’s
new frock, and am wanting to sit down and rest a little.
What do you think of the color! Pretty, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Charming,” said Sigrid. “Let me do the tacking for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no; you look tired, my child; sit down here by the
stove, and I will tack it together as we chat. What makes
those dark patches beneath your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it is nothing. I could not sleep last night, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because you were worrying over something. That does
not pay, child; give it up. It’s a bad habit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think I can help it,” said Sigrid. “We all of us
have a natural tendency that way. Don’t you remember how
Frithiof never could sleep before an examination?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you perhaps were worrying your brain about him?
Was that it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Partly,” said Sigrid, looking down and speaking nervously.
“You see it was in this way—I had a chance of becoming rich
and well to do, of stepping into a position which would have
made me able to help the others, and because it did not come
up to my own notion of happiness I threw away the chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so little by little and mentioning no name, she put
before the motherly old lady all the facts of the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Child,” said Fru Askevold, “I have only one piece of advice
to give you—be true to your own ideal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But then one’s own ideal may be unattainable in this world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps, and if so it can’t be helped. But if you mean your
marriage to be a happy one, then be true. Half the unhappy
marriages come from people stooping to take just what they can
get. If you accepted this man’s offer you might be wronging
some girl who is really capable of loving him properly.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Then you mean that some of us have higher ideals than
others?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, yes, to be sure; it is the same in this as in every
thing else, and what you have to do is just to shut your ears to
all the well-meaning but false maxims of the world, and listen
to the voice in your own heart. Depend upon it, you will be
able to do far more for Frithiof and Swanhild if you are true to
yourself than you would be able to do as a rich woman and
an unhappy wife.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid was silent for some moments.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” she said, at length. “I see things much more
clearly now; last night I could only see things through Aunt
Grönvold’s spectacles, and I think they must be very short-sighted
ones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fru Askevold laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is quite true,” she said. “The marriages brought
about by scheming relatives may look promising enough at first,
but in the long run they always bring trouble and misery.
The true marriages are made in heaven, Sigrid, though folks
are slow to believe that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid went away comforted, yet nevertheless life was not very
pleasant to her just then, for although she had the satisfaction
of seeing Torvald walking the streets of Bergen without any
signs of great dejection in his face, she had all day long to endure
the consciousness of her aunt’s vexation, and to feel in every
little economy that this need not have been practiced had she
decided as Fru Grönvold wished. It was on the whole a very
dreary Christmas, yet the sadness was brightened by one little
act of kindness and courtesy which to the end of her life she
never forgot. For after all it is that which is rare that makes
a deep impression on us. The word of praise spoken at the
beginning of our career lingers forever in our hearts with something
of the glow of encouragement and hopefulness which it
first kindled there; while the applause of later years glides off
us like water off a duck’s back. The little bit of kindness
shown in days of trouble is remembered when greater kindness
during days of prosperity has been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Christmas-eve. Sigrid sat in her cold bedroom,
wrapped round in an eider-down quilt. She was reading over
again the letter she had last received from Frithiof, just one of
those short unsatisfying letters which of late he had sent her.
From Germany he had written amusingly enough, but these London
letters often left her more unhappy than they found her, not
so much from anything they said as from what they left unsaid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Since last Christmas all had been taken away from her, and
now it seemed to her that even Frithiof’s love was growing
cold, and her tears fell fast on the thin little sheet of paper
where she had tried so hard to read love and hope between the
lines, and had tried in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>A knock at the door made her dry her eyes hastily, and she
was relieved to find that it was not her Cousin Karen who entered,
but Swanhild, with a sunny face and blue eyes dancing
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look, Sigrid,” she cried, “here is a parcel which looks exactly
like a present. Do make haste and open it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They cut the string and folded back the paper, Sigrid giving a
little cry of surprise as she saw before her the water-color
sketch of Bergen, which had been her father’s last present to
her on the day before his death. Unable to pay for it, she had
asked the proprietor of the shop to take it back again, and had
been relieved by his ready consent. Glancing quickly at the
accompanying note, she saw that it bore his signature. It ran
as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Madame</span>: Will you do me the honor of accepting the
water-color sketch of Bergen chosen by the late Herr Falck in
October. At your wish I took back the picture then and regarded
the purchase as though it had never been made. I now
ask you to receive it as a Christmas-gift and a slight token of
my respect for the memory of your father,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!” cried Sigrid, “isn’t that good of him! And how
nice of him to wait for Christmas instead of sending it straight
back. Now I shall have something to send to Frithiof. It
will get to him in time for the new year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a splendid idea! I had not thought of that. And
we shall have it up here just for Christmas-day. How pretty
it is! People are very kind, I think!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Sigrid felt the little clinging arm round her waist, and
as they looked at the picture together she smoothed back the
child’s golden hair tenderly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” she said, smiling, “after all, people are very kind.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Preston Askevold had feared, Frithiof bore the troubles
much less easily. He was without Sigrid’s sweetness of nature,
without her patience, and the little touch of philosophic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>matter-of-factness which helped her to endure. He was far
more sensitive too, and was terribly handicapped by the bitterness
which was the almost inevitable result of his treatment by
Blanche Morgan, a bitterness which stirred him up into a sort
of contemptuous hatred of both God and man. Sigrid, with
her quiet common sense, her rarely expressed but very real
faith, struggled on through the winter and the spring, and in the
process managed to grow and develop; but Frithiof, in his desolate
London lodgings, with his sore heart and rebellious intellect,
grew daily more hard and morose. Had it not been for
the Bonifaces he must have gone altogether to the bad, but the
days which he spent every now and then in that quiet, simple
household, where kindness reigned supreme, saved him from
utter ruin. For always through the darkest part of every life
there runs, though we may sometimes fail to see it, this “golden
thread of love,” so that even the worst man on earth is not
wholly cut off from God, since He will, by some means or
other, eternally try to draw him out of death into life. We
are astounded now and then to read that some cold-blooded
murderer, some man guilty of a hideous crime, will ask in his
last moments to see a child who loved him devotedly, and whom
he also loved. We are astonished just because we do not understand
the untiring heart of the All-Father who in His goodness
often gives to the vilest sinner the love of a pure-hearted
woman or child. So true is the beautiful old Latin saying,
long in the world but little believed, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mergere nos patitur, sed
non submergere, Christus</span>” (Christ lets us sink may be, but
not drown).</p>

<p class='c000'>Just at this time there was only one thing on which Frithiof
found any satisfaction, and that was in the little store of money
which by slow degrees he was able to place in the savings bank.
In what way it could ever grow into a sum large enough to
pay his father’s creditors he did not trouble himself to think,
but week by week it did increase, and with this one aim in life
he struggled on, working early and late, and living on an
amount of food which could have horrified an Englishman.
Luckily he had discovered a place in Oxford Street where he
could get a good dinner every day for sixpence, but this was
practically his only meal, and after some months the scanty fare
began to tell upon him, so that even the Miss Turnours noticed
that something was wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That young man looks to me underfed,” said Miss Caroline
one day. “I met him on the stairs just now, and he seems to
me to have grown paler and thinner. What does he have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>for breakfast, Charlotte? Does he eat as well as the other
lodgers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear me, no,” said Miss Charlotte. “It’s my belief that
he eats nothing at all but ship’s biscuits. There’s a tin of them
up in his room, and a tin of cocoa, which he makes for himself.
All I ever take him is a jug of boiling water night and morning!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor fellow!” said Miss Caroline, sighing a little as she
plaited some lace which must have been washed a hundred
times into her dress.</p>

<p class='c000'>A delicate carefulness in these little details of dress distinguished
the three ladies—they had inherited it with the spelling
of their name and other tokens of good breeding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel sorry for him,” she added. “He always bows very
politely when I meet him, and he is remarkably good-looking,
though with a disagreeable expression.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When one is hungry one seldom looks agreeable,” said Miss
Charlotte. “I wish I had noticed him before,” and she remembered,
with a little pang of remorse, that she had more than
once preached to him about his soul, while all the time she had
been too dreamy and unobservant to see what was really wrong
with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose,” she said timidly, “suppose I were to take him a
little of the stewed American beef we shall have for supper.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Send it up by the girl,” said Miss Turnour, “she is still in
the kitchen. Don’t take it yourself—it would be awkward for
both of you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So Miss Charlotte meekly obeyed, and sent up by the shabby
servant-girl a most savory little supper. Unluckily the girl was
a pert cockney, and her loud, abrupt knock at the door in itself
irritated Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come in,” he said, in a surly tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here,” said the girl, “here’s something to put you in
a better temper. Missus’s compliments, and she begs you’ll
accept it,” and she thrust the tray at him with a derisive grin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have the goodness to take that down again,” said Frithiof,
in a fit of unreasoning anger. “I’ll not be treated like your mistress’
pet dog.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in his manner cowed the girl. She beat a hasty
retreat, and was planning how she could manage to eat the despised
supper herself, when at the foot of the stairs she met
Miss Charlotte, and her project was nipped in the bud.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It aint no use, miss, ’e wont touch it,” she explained;
“’e was as angry as could be, and says ’e, ‘Take it away. I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>not be treated like your mistress’ pet dog,’ says ’e. So, bein’
frightened, I ran downstairs agen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Charlotte looked troubled, and later on, when as usual
she took up the jug of hot water, she felt nervous and uncomfortable,
and her knock was more timid than ever. However,
she had scarcely set down the jug on the floor when there came
sounds of hasty footsteps in the room, and Frithiof flung open
the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I beg your pardon,” he said. “You meant to be kind, I’m
sure, but the girl was rude, and I lost my temper. I ask your
forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were both pathetic and comic elements in the little
scene; the meek Miss Charlotte stood trembling as if she had
seen a ghost, gazing up at the tall Norseman who, in the hurry
of the moment, had forgotten to remove the wet towel which,
in common with most night-workers, he was in the habit of
tying round his forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Charlotte stooped to pick up the jug.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am so sorry the girl was rude,” she said. “I wish I had
brought it myself. You see, it was in this way; we all thought
you looking so poorly, and we were having the beef for supper
and we thought perhaps you might fancy some, and—and—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was very good of you,” he said, touched, in spite of himself,
by the kindness. “I regret what I said, but you must
make allowance for a bad-tempered man with a splitting headache.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that the reason you tie it up?” asked Miss Charlotte.</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed and pulled off the towel, passing his hand over
the mass of thick light hair which it had disordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It keeps it cooler,” he said, “and I can get through more
work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She glanced at the table, and saw that it was covered with
papers and books.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you wise to do so much work after being busy all day?”
she said. “It seems to me that you are not looking well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is nothing but headache,” he said. “And the work is
the only pleasure I have in the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was afraid from your looks that you had a hard life,” she
said hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not hard outwardly. As far as work goes it is easy
enough, but there is a deadly monotony about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! if only”—she began.</p>

<p class='c000'>He interrupted her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know quite well what you are going to say—you are going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to recommend me to attend one of those religious meetings
where people get so full of a delightful excitement. Believe
me, they would not have the slightest effect on me. And yet,
if you wish it, I will go. It shall be my sign of penitence for
my rudeness just now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Charlotte could not make out whether his smile was
sarcastic or genuine. However, she took him at his word, and
the next evening carried him off to a big brightly lighted hall,
to a revivalist meeting, from which she hoped great things.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a hot June evening. He came there tired with the
long day’s work, and his head felt dull and heavy. Merely
out of politeness to his companion he tried to take some sort
of interest in what went on, stifled his inclination to laugh
now and then, and watched the proceedings attentively, though
wearily enough. In front of him rose a large platform with
tiers of seats one above the other. The men and women
seated there had bright-looking faces. Some looked self-conscious
and self-satisfied, several of the women seemed overwrought
and hysterical, but others had a genuine look of
content which impressed him. Down below was a curiously
heterogeneous collection of instruments—cornets, drums, tambourines,
trumpets, and pipes. A hymn was given out, followed
by a chorus; the words were solemn, but the tune was
the reverse; still it seemed to please the audience, who sung
three choruses to each verse, the first loud, the second louder,
the third a perfect frenzy of sound, the drums thundering, the
tambourines dashing about wildly, the pipes and cornets at
their shrillest, and every one present singing or shouting with
all his might. It took him some time to recover from the appalling
noise, and meantime a woman was praying. He did not
much attend to what she said, but the audience seemed to agree
with her, for every minute or two there was a chorus of fervent
“Amens,” which rolled through the hall like distant thunder.
After that the young man who conducted the meeting read a
story out of the Bible, and spoke well and with a sort of simple
directness. There was very little in what he said, but he meant
every word of it. It might have been summed up in three sentences:
“There is only one way of being happy. I have tried
it and have found it answer. All you who haven’t tried it
begin at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the words which meant much to him conveyed nothing
to Frithiof. He listened, and wondered how a man of his own
age could possibly get up and say such things. What was it he
had found? How had he found it? If the speaker had shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the least sign of vanity his words would have been utterly powerless;
but his quiet positiveness impressed people, and it was
apparent to every one that he believed in a strength which was
not his own. There followed much that seemed to Frithiof
monotonous and undesirable; about thirty people on the platform,
one after another, got up and spoke a few words, which
invariably began with “I thank the Lord I was saved on such
and such a night.” He wondered and wondered what the
phrase meant to them, and revolved in his mind all the
theological dogmas he had ever heard of. Suddenly he was
startled to find that some one was addressing him, a hymn
was being sung, and there was a good deal of movement in the
hall; people went and came, and an elderly woman had stepped
forward and taken a place beside him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brother,” she said to him, “are you saved?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Madame,” he replied coldly, “I have not the slightest idea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, then,” she said, with a little gesture that reminded
him of Miss Charlotte, “let me beg you to come at once to
Christ.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Madame,” he said, still in his coldly polite voice, “you
must really excuse me, but I do not know what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was so much surprised and puzzled by both words and
manner that she hesitated what to reply; and Frithiof, who
hated being questioned, took his hat from the bench, and bowing
formally to her, left the hall. In the street he was joined
by Miss Charlotte.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!” she exclaimed, “I am so sorry you said that. You
will have made that poor woman so terribly unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is all her own fault,” said Frithiof. “Why did she come
meddling with my private affairs? If her belief was real she
would have been able to explain it in a rational way, instead of
using phrases which are just empty words.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You didn’t leave her time to explain. And as to her belief
being real, do you think, if it were not real, that little, frail
woman would have had courage to go twice to prison for speaking
in the streets? Do you think she would have been able to
convert the most abandoned thieves, and induce them to make
restitution, paying in week by week what they could earn to
replace what they had stolen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does she do that? Then I respect her. When you see
her again please apologize for my abruptness, and tell her that
her form of religion is too noisy for my head and too illogical
for my mind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They walked home in silence, Miss Charlotte grieving over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the hopeless failure of the meeting to achieve what she desired.
She had not yet learned that different natures need different
kinds of food, and that to expect Frithiof to swallow the teachings
which exactly suited certain minds was about as sensible
as to feed a baby with Thorley’s Food for Cattle. However,
there never yet was an honest attempt to do good which really
failed, though the vast majority fail apparently. It was impossible
that the revivalists’ teaching could ever be accepted by the
Norseman; but their ardent devotion, their practical, aggressive
lives, impressed him not a little, and threw a somewhat
disagreeable light over his own selfishness. Partly owing to
this, partly from physical causes, he felt bitterly out of heart
with himself for the next few weeks. In truth he was thoroughly
out of health, and he had not the only power which can hold
irritability in check—the strong restraint of love. Except a
genuine liking for the Bonifaces, he had nothing to take him out
of himself, and he was quite ready to return with interest the
dislike which the other men in the shop felt for him, first on
account of his foreign birth, but chiefly because of his proud
manner and hasty temper. Sometimes he felt that he could
bear the life no longer; and at times, out of his very wretchedness,
there sprung up in him a vague pity for those who were
in his own position. As he stood there behind the counter he
would say to himself, “There are thousands and thousands in
this city alone who have day after day to endure this horrible
monotony, to serve the customers who are rude, and the customers
who are civil, the hurried ones who are all impatience, the
tiresome ones who dawdle, the bores, who give you as much
trouble as they can, often for nothing. One day follows another
eternally in the same dull round. I am a hundred times
better off than most—there are no hurried meals here, no fines,
no unfairness—and yet what drudgery it is!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And as he glanced out at the sunny street and heard the sound
of horses’ hoofs in the road, a wild longing used to seize him for
the freedom and variety of his life in Norway, and the old fierce
rebellion against his fate woke once more in his heart, and made
him ready to fly into a rage on the smallest provocation.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day he was sent for to Mr. Boniface’s private room; he
was quite well aware that his manner, even to Roy himself, whom
he liked, had been disagreeable in the extreme, and the thought
crossed his mind that he was going to receive notice to leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Boniface was sitting at his writing-table, the sunlight
fell on his quiet, refined face, lighted up his white hair and
trim beard, and made his kindly gray eyes brighter than ever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“I wanted a few words with you, Falck,” he said. “Sit
down. It seems to me that you have not been looking well
lately, and I thought perhaps you had better take your holiday
at once instead of the third week in August. I have spoken
to Darnell, and he would be willing to give you his turn and
take the later time. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very good, sir,” said Frithiof, “but I shall do very
well with the August holiday, and, as a matter of fact, it will
only mean that I shall do more translating.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you not do well to go home? Come, think of it, I
would give you three weeks if you want to go to Bergen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof felt a choking sensation in his throat, because it was
of the old life that he had been dreaming all the morning with
a restless, miserable craving.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” he said, with an effort, “but I can not go
back to Norway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, tell me candidly, Falck, is it the question of expense
that hinders you?” said Mr. Boniface. “Because if it is merely
that, I would gladly lend you the money. You must remember
that you have had a great deal to bear lately, and I think
you ought to give yourself a good rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” replied Frithiof, “but it is not exactly the
expense. I have money enough in hand to pay for my passage,
but I have made up my mind not to go back till I can clear off
the last of the debts of—of our firm,” he concluded, with a
slight quiver in his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a noble resolution,” said Mr. Boniface, “and I would
not for a moment discourage you. Still you must remember that
it is a great undertaking, and that without good health you can
never hope for success. I don’t think you get enough exercise.
Now, why don’t you join our cricket club?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t play,” said Frithiof. “In Norway we are not great
at those games, or indeed at any kind of exercise for the mere
sake of exercise. That is an idea that one only finds among
Englishmen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Possibly; but living in our climate you would do well to
follow our habits. Come, let me persuade you to join the club.
You look to me as if you needed greater variety.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will think about it for next year; but just now I have
work for Herr Sivertsen on hand which I can’t put aside,” said
Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, then, things must go on as they are for the present,”
said Mr. Boniface; “but at least you can bring your translating
down to Rowan Tree House, and spend your holiday with us.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“You are very kind,” said Frithiof, the boyish expression
returning to his face just for a minute. “I shall be only too
delighted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the interview seemed somehow to have done him good,
for during the next few days he was less irritable, and found
his work in consequence less irksome.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But the change for the better did not last long, for Frithiof
was without the motive which “makes drudgery divine.” And
there was no denying that the work he had to do was really
drudgery.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been the fashion of late years to dwell much on the misery
of the slums, and most of us are quite ready to be stirred into
active sympathy with the abjectly poor, the hungry, or the destitute.
It is to be feared, however, that very few of us have
much consideration for the less romantic, less sensational lives
of the middle class, the thousands who toil for us day after
day behind the counter or at the desk. And yet are their lives
one whit less worthy of sympathy? Are they not educated to
a point which makes them infinitely more sensitive? Hood has
given us a magnificent poem on the sorrows of a shirt-maker;
but who will take trouble to find poetry in the sorrows and weariness
of shop assistants? It has been said that the very atmosphere
of trade kills romance, that no poet or novelist would
dare to take up such a theme; and yet everywhere the human
heart is the same, and shop-life does not interfere with the loves
and hatreds, the joys and sorrows which make up the life of
every human being, and out of which are woven all the romances
which were ever written. No one would dispute the saying
that labor is worship, yet nevertheless we know well enough
that while some work of itself ennobles the worker, there is
other work which has to be ennobled by the way in which it is
done. An artist and a coal-heaver both toil for the general
good, but most people will admit that the coal-heaver is heavily
handicapped. If in the actual work of shop assistants there is
a prosaic monotony, then it is all the more probable that they
need our warmest sympathy, our most thoughtful considerateness,
since they themselves are no machines, but men and
women with exactly the same hopes and desires as the rest of
us. It is because we consider them of a different order that
we tolerate the long hours, that we allow women to stand all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>day long to serve us, though it has been proved that terrible
diseases are the consequence. It is because we do not in our
hearts believe that they are of the same flesh and blood, that we
think with a sort of contempt of the very people who are brought
most directly into contact with us, and whose hard-working
lives often put ours to shame.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the middle of July the Bonifaces went down to Devonshire
for their usual summer holiday, and Frithiof found that,
as Roy had predicted, Mr. Horner made himself most disagreeable,
and never lost a chance of interfering. It must be owned
that there are few things so trying as fussiness, particularly in
a man, of whom such weakness seems unworthy. And Mr.
Horner was the most fussy mortal on earth. It seemed as if
he called forth all that was bad in Frithiof, and Frithiof also
called out everything that was bad in him. The breach between
the two was made much wider by a most trivial incident.
A miserable-looking dog unluckily made its way into the shop
one morning and disturbed Mr. Horner in his sanctum.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the meaning of this?” he exclaimed, bearing down
upon Frithiof. “Can you not keep stray curs off the premises?
Just now too, with hydrophobia raging!” And he drove and
kicked the dog to the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now there is one thing which no Norseman can tolerate for
a moment, and that is any sort of cruelty to animals. Frithiof, in
his fury, did not measure his words, or speak as the employed
to the employer, and from that time Mr. Horner’s hatred of
him increased tenfold. To add to all this wretchedness an almost
tropical heat set in, London was like a huge, overheated
oven; every day Frithiof found the routine of business less
bearable, every day he was less able to fight against his love for
Blanche, and he rapidly sunk into the state which hard-headed
people flatter themselves is a mere foolish fancy—that most
real and trying form of illness which goes by the name of depression.
Again and again he wrestled with the temptation that
had assailed him long ago in Hyde Park, and each sight of
James Horner, each incivility from those he had to serve, made
the struggle harder.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was sitting at his desk one morning adding up a column
which had been twice interrupted, and which had three times
come to a different result, when once again the swing-door was
pushed open, and a shadow falling across his account-book
warned him that the customer had come to the song-counter.
Annoyed and impatient, he put down his pen and went forward,
forcing up the sort of cold politeness which he assumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>now, and which differed strangely from the bright, genial
courtesy, that had once been part of his nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The customer was evidently an Italian. He was young and
strikingly handsome; when he glanced at you, you felt that
he had looked you through and through, yet that his look
was not critical, but kindly; it penetrated yet at the same
time warmed. Beside him was a bright-eyed boy who looked
up curiously at the Norseman, as though wondering how on
such a sunny day any one could wear such a clouded face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Frithiof was quite in the humor to dislike any one,
more especially a man who was young, handsome, well-dressed,
and prosperous-looking; but some subtle influence
crept over him the instant he heard the Italian’s voice; his
hard eyes softened a little, and without being able to explain
it he felt a strong desire to help this man in finding the song
which he had come to inquire about, knowing only the
words and the air, not the name of the composer. Frithiof,
who would ordinarily have been inclined to grumble at the
trouble which the search involved, now threw himself into
it heart and soul, and was as pleased as his customer when
after some little time he chanced to find the song.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand thanks,” said the Italian warmly. “I am
delighted to get hold of this; it is for a friend who has long
wanted to hear it again, but who was only able to write
down the first part of the air.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he compared the printed song with the little bit of
manuscript which he had shown to Frithiof. “Now, was it
only a happy fluke that made you think of Knight’s name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know another of his songs, and thought this bore a
sort of likeness to it,” said Frithiof, pleased with his success.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know much more of English music than I do, most
likely,” said the Italian; “yet surely you, too, are a foreigner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frithiof, “I am Norwegian. I have only
been here for nine months, but to try and learn a little
about the music is the only interesting part of this work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The stranger’s sympathetic insight showed him much of
the weariness and discontent and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</span></i> which lay
beneath these words.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, yes,” he said, “I suppose both work and country
seem flat and dull after your life among the fjords and
mountains. I know well enough the depression of one’s
first year in a new climate. But courage! the worst will pass.
I have grown to love this England which once I detested.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“It is the airlessness of London which depresses one,” said
poor Frithiof, rolling up the song.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it is certainly very oppressive to-day,” said the Italian;
“I am sorry to have given you so much trouble in hunting
up this song for me. We may as well take it with us, Gigi, as
we are going home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then with a pleasant farewell the stranger bowed and
went out of the shop, leaving behind him a memory which did
more to prevent the blue devils from gaining the mastery of
Frithiof’s mind than anything else could possibly have done.
When he left, however, at his usual dinner hour, he was without
the slightest inclination to eat, and with a craving for some relief
from the monotony of the glaring streets he walked up to Regent’s
Park, hoping that there perhaps he might find the fresh
air for which he was longing. He thought much of his unknown
customer, half laughing to himself now and then to think that
such a chance encounter should have made upon him so deep
an impression, should have wakened within him desires such as
he had never before felt for a life which should be higher, nobler,
more manly than his past.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come along, will you?” shouted a rough voice behind him.
He glanced round and saw an evil-looking tramp who was
speaking to a most forlorn little boy at his heels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The child seemed ready to drop, but with a look of misery
and fear and effort most painful to see in such a young face,
it hurried on, keeping up a wretched little sort of trot at the
heels of its father, who tramped on doggedly. Frithiof was not
in the habit of troubling himself much about those he came
across in life, his heart had been too much embittered by
Blanche’s treatment, he had got into the way now of looking
on coldly and saying with a shrug of the shoulders that it was
the way of the world. But to-day the magical influence of a
noble life was stirring within him; a man utterly unknown to
him had spoken to him a few kindly words, had treated him
with rare considerateness, had somehow raised him into a
purer atmosphere. And so it happened that he, too, began
to feel something of the same divine sympathy, and to forget
his own wretchedness in the suffering of the little child. Presently
the tramp paused outside a public-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait for me there in the park,” he said to the child, giving
it a push in the direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the little fellow went on obediently, until, just at the
gate, he caught sight of a costermonger’s barrow on which cool
green leaves and ripe red strawberries were temptingly displayed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Frithiof lingered a minute to see what would happen,
but nothing happened at all, the child just stood there patiently.
There was no expectation on his tired little face, nothing but
intense appreciation of a luxury which must forever be beyond
his hopes of enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you ever tasted them?” said Frithiof, drawing nearer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy shook his head shyly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you like to?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Still he did not speak, but a look of rapture dawned in the
wistful child eyes, and he gave a little spring in the air which
was more eloquent than words.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Six-pennyworth,” said Frithiof to the costermonger; then
signing to the child to follow, he led the way into the park, sat
down on the nearest seat, put the basket of strawberries down
beside him, and glanced at his little companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There, now, sit down by me and enjoy them,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the child needed no second bidding, but began to eat
with an eager delight which was pleasant to see. After awhile
he paused, however, and shyly pushed the basket a little nearer
to his benefactor. Frithiof, absorbed in his own thoughts, did
not notice it, but presently became conscious of a small brown
hand on his sleeve, and looked round.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eat too,” said the child, pointing to the basket.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Frithiof, to please him, smiled and took two or three
strawberries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There, the rest are for you,” he said. “Do you like them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said the child emphatically; “and I like you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you like me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was tired, and you was kind to me, and these is real
jammy!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But after this fervent little speech, he said no more. He
did not, as a Norwegian child would have done, shake hands as
a sign of gratitude, or say in the pretty Norse way, “<i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Tak for
maden</span></i>” (thanks for the meal); there had never been any one
to teach him the expression of the courtesies of life, and with
him they were not innate. He merely looked at his friend with
shining eyes like some animal that feels but cannot speak its
gratitude. Then before long the father reappeared, and the
little fellow with one shy nod of the head ran off, looking back
wistfully every now and then at the stranger who would be remembered
by him to the very end of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day something happened which added the last
drops to Frithiof’s cup of misery, and made it overflow. The
troubles of the past year, and the loneliness and poverty which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>he had borne, had gradually broken down his health, and there
came to him now a revelation which proved the final blow. He
was dining at his usual restaurant. Too tired to eat much, he
had taken up a bit of one of the society papers which some
one had left there, and his eye fell on one of those detestable
paragraphs which pander to the very lowest tastes of the public.
No actual name was given, but every one knowing anything
about her could not fail to see that Blanche Romiaux was the
woman referred to. The most revolting insinuations, the most
contemptible gossip, ended with the words, “An interesting
divorce case may soon be expected.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof grew deathly white. He tried to believe that it was
all a lie, tried to work himself up into a rage against the editor
of the paper, tried to assure himself that, whatever Blanche
might have been before marriage, after it she must necessarily
become all that was womanly and pure. But deep down
in his heart there lurked a fearful conviction that in the main
this story was true. Feeling sick and giddy, he made his way
along Oxford Street, noticing nothing, walking like a man in a
dream. Just in front of Buzzard’s a victoria was waiting, and
a remarkably good-looking man stood on the pavement talking
to its occupant. Frithiof would have passed by without observing
them had not a familiar voice startled him into keen consciousness.
He looked up hastily and saw Lady Romiaux—not
the Blanche who had won his heart in Norway, for the lips
that had once been pressed to his wore a hard look of defiance,
and the eyes that had insnared him had now an expression that
confirmed only too well the story he had just read. He heard
her give a little artificial laugh in which there was not even the
ghost of merriment, and after that it seemed as if a great cloud
had descended on him. He moved on mechanically, but it
was chiefly by a sort of instinct that he found his way back to the
shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good heavens, Mr. Falck! how ill you are looking!” exclaimed
the head man as he glanced at him. “It’s a good
thing Mr. Robert will be back again soon. If I’m not very much
mistaken, he’ll put you into the doctor’s hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it is chiefly this hot weather,” said Frithiof, and as if
anxious to put an end to the conversation, he turned away to
his desk and began to write, though each word cost him a painful
effort, and seemed to be dragged out of him by sheer force.
At tea-time he wandered out in the street, scarcely knowing
what he was doing, and haunted always by Blanche’s sadly
altered face. When he returned he found that the boy who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>dusted the shop had spilled some ink over his order-book,
whereupon he flew into one of those violent passions to which
of late he had been liable, so entirely losing his self-control
that those about him began to look alarmed. This recalled
him to himself, and much disgusted at having made such a
scene, he sunk into a state of black depression. He could not
understand himself; could not make out what was wrong;
could not conceive how such a trifle could have stirred him
into such senseless rage. He sat, pen in hand, too sick and
miserable to work, and with a wild confusion of thoughts rushing
through his brain. He was driving along the Strand-gaden
with Blanche, and talking gayly of the intense enjoyment of
mere existence; he was rowing her on the fjord, and telling her
the Frithiof Saga; he was saving her on the mountain, and
listening to her words of love; he was down in the sheltered
nook below the flagstaff at Balholm, and she was clinging to
him in the farewell which had indeed been forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can bear it no longer,” he said to himself. “I have tried
to bear this life, but it’s no use—no use.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet after a while there rose within him a thought which
checked the haunting visions of failure and the longing for
death. He remembered the face which had so greatly struck
him the day before, and again those kindly words rang in his ear,
“Courage! the worst will pass.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Who was this man? What gave him his extraordinary influence?
How had he gained his insight, and sympathy, and fearless
brightness? If one man had attained to all this, why not
any man? Might not life still hold for him something that was
worth having? There floated back to him the remembrance of
the last pleasurable moment he had known—it was the sight of
the child’s enjoyment of the strawberries.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length closing-time came. He dragged himself back to
Vauxhall, shut himself into his dreary little room, pulled the
table toward the open window, and began to work at Herr
Sivertsen’s translating. Night after night he had gone on, with
the dogged courage of his old Viking ancestors, upheld by the
same fierce, fighting nature which had made them the terror of
the North. But at last he was at the very end of his strength.
A violent shivering fit seized him. Work was no longer possible;
he could only stagger to the bed, with that terrible consciousness
of being utterly and hopelessly beaten, which to a
man is so hard to bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oppressed by a frightful sense of loneliness, dazed by physical
pain, and tortured by the thought of Blanche’s disgrace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>there was yet one thing which gave him moments of relief—like
a child he strained his eyes to see the picture of Bergen
which hung by the bedside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later on, when the summer twilight deepened into night,
and he could no longer make out the harbor, and the shipping,
and the familiar mountains, he buried his face in the pillow and
sobbed aloud, in a forlorn misery which, even in Paradise, must
have wrung his mother’s heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy Boniface came back from Devonshire the following day,
his holiday being shortened by a week on account of the illness
of Mrs. Horner’s uncle. As there was every reason to expect
a legacy from this aged relative, Mr. Horner insisted on
going down at once to see whether they could be of any use;
and since the shop was never left without one of the partners,
poor Roy, anathematizing the whole race of the Horners, had
to come back and endure as best he might a London August
and an empty house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like many other business men, he relieved the monotony of
his daily work by always keeping two or three hobbies in hand.
The mania for collecting had always been encouraged at Rowan
Tree House, and just now botany was his keenest delight. It
was even perhaps absorbing too much of his time, and Cecil
used laughingly to tell him that he loved it more than all the
men and women in the world put together. He was contentedly
mounting specimens on the night of his return, when
James Horner looked in, the prospective legacy making him
more than ever fussy and pompous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, so you have come: that’s all right!” he exclaimed.
“I had hoped you would have come round to us. However,
no matter; I don’t know that there is anything special to say,
and of course this sad news has upset my wife very much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah,” said Roy, somewhat skeptical in his heart of hearts
about the depth of her grief. “We were sorry to hear
about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We go down the first thing to-morrow,” said James Horner,
“and shall, of course, stay on. They say there is no hope of
recovery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think of that?” said Roy, pointing to a very
minute flower which he had just mounted. “It is the first
time it has ever been found in England.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“H’m, is it really?” said James Horner, regarding it with
that would-be interested air, that bored perplexity, which Roy
took a wicked delight in calling forth. “Well, you know, I
don’t understand,” he added, “how a practical man like you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>can take an interest in such trumpery bits of things. What
are your flowers worth when you’ve done them? Now, if you
took to collecting autographs, there’d be some sense in that,
for I understand that a fine collection of autographs fetches
a good round sum in the market.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That would only involve more desk-work,” said Roy,
laughing. “Writing to ask for them would bore me as much
as writing in reply must bore the poor celebrities.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the by,” said Mr. Horner, “I have just remembered
to tell you that provoking fellow, Falck, never turned up to-day.
He never even had the grace to send word that he wasn’t
coming.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course he must be ill,” said Roy, looking disturbed.
“He is the last fellow to stay away if he could possibly keep
up. We all thought him looking ill before he left.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know about illness,” said James Horner, putting
on his hat; “but he certainly has the worst temper I’ve ever
come across. It was extremely awkward without him to-day,
for already we are short of hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There can hardly be much doing,” said Roy. “London
looks like a desert. However, of course I’ll look up Falck. I
dare say he’ll be all right again by to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had scarcely settled himself down comfortably to his
work after James Horner’s welcome departure when the thought
of Frithiof came to trouble him. After all, was it likely that a
mere trifle would hinder a man of the Norwegian’s nature from
going to business? Was it not much more probable that he
was too ill even to write an excuse? And if so, how helpless
and desolate he would be!</p>

<p class='c000'>Like most people, Roy was selfish. Had he lived alone he
would have become more selfish every day; but it was impossible
to live in the atmosphere of Rowan Tree House without,
at any rate, trying to consider other people. With an
effort he tore himself away from his beloved specimens, and
set off briskly for Vauxhall, where, after some difficulty, he
found the little side street in which, among dozens of others
precisely like it, was the house of the three Miss Turnours.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little withered-up lady opened the door to him, and replied
nervously to his question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Falck is ill,” she said. “He seems very feverish;
but he was like it once before, when he first came to England,
and it passed off in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can I see him?” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, he doesn’t like being disturbed at all,” said Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Charlotte. “He’ll hardly let me inside the room. But if you
would just see him, I should really be glad. You will judge
better if he should see the doctor or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, I’ll go up then. Don’t let me trouble you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is noise he seems to mind so much,” said Miss Charlotte.
“So if you will find your way up alone, perhaps it
would be best. It is the first door you come to at the top of
the last flight of stairs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy went up quietly, opened the door as noiselessly as he
could, and went in. The window faced the sunset, so that the
room was still fairly light, and the utter discomfort of everything
was fully apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you wouldn’t come in again,” said an irritable voice
from the bed. “The lightest footstep is torture.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I just looked in to ask how you were,” said Roy, much
shocked to see how ill his friend seemed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it’s you!” said Frithiof, turning his flushed face in the
direction of the speaker. “Thank God, you’ve come! That
woman will be the death of me. She does nothing but ask
questions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve only just got back from Devonshire, but they said you
hadn’t turned up to-day, and I thought I would come and see
after you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof dragged himself up and drank feverishly from the
ewer which stood on a chair beside him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tried to come this morning,” he said, “but I was too
giddy to stand, and had to give it up. My head’s gone wrong
somehow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor fellow! you should have given up before,” said Roy.
“You seem in terrible pain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes; it’s like a band of hot iron,” moaned poor
Frithiof. Then suddenly starting up in wild excitement,
“There’s Blanche! there’s Blanche! Let me go to her! Let
me go! I will see her once more—only this once!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy with some difficulty held him down, and after awhile
he seemed to come to himself. “Was I talking nonsense?”
he said. “It’s a horrid feeling not being able to control one’s
self. If I go crazy you can just let me die, please. Life’s bad
enough now, and would be intolerable then. There she is
again! She’s smiling at me. Oh, Blanche—you did care
once. Come back! Come back! He can’t love you as I
love! But it’s no use—no use! she is worse than dead. I
tell you I saw it in that cursed paper, and I saw it in her own
face. Why, one might have known! All women are like it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>What do they dare so long as their vanity is satisfied? It’s
just as Björnsen says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘If thou hadst not so smiled on me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now I should not thus weep for thee.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And then he fell into incoherent talk, chiefly in Norwegian,
but every now and then repeating the English rendering of
Björnsen’s lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Roy turned over in his mind half a dozen
schemes, and at length decided to leave Frithiof during one of
the quiet intervals, while he went for their own doctor, Miss
Charlotte mounting guard outside the door, and promising to
go to him if he seemed to need care.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Morris, who was an old friend, listened to Roy’s description,
and returned with him at once, much to the relief of poor
Miss Charlotte, who was frightened out of her senses by one of
Frithiof’s paroxysms of wild excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think seriously of him?” said Roy, when, the
excitement having died down, Frithiof lay in a sort of stupor,
taking no notice at all of his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If we can manage to get him any sleep he will pull through
all right,” said Dr. Morris, in his abrupt way. “If not, he
will sink before many days. You had better send for his
mother, if he has one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has only a sister, and she is in Norway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, send for her, for he will need careful nursing. You
say you will take charge of him? Very well; and to-morrow
morning I will send in a nurse, who will set you at liberty for a
few hours. Evidently he has had some shock. Can you
make out what it was at all?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well; last autumn, I believe—indeed, I am sure—he was
jilted by an English girl with whom he was desperately in love.
It all came upon the top of the other troubles of which I told
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what is this paper he raves about? What is the girl’s
name? We might get some clew in that way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” said Roy, “she was married some months ago. She
is now Lady Romiaux.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor gave a stifled exclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That explains all. I suppose the poor fellow honestly
cared for her, and was shocked to see the paragraph in this
week’s <em>Idle Time</em>. Your friend has had a narrow escape, if
he could but see it in that light. For the husband of that
heartless little flirt must be the most miserable man alive. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>shall soon have another of those detestable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">causes célèbres</span></i>, and
the newspapers lying about in every household will be filled
with all the poisonous details.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As Roy kept watch through the long nights and days that
followed, as he listened to the delirious ravings of his patient,
and perceived how a man’s life and health had been ruined by
the faithlessness of a vain girl, he became so absorbed in poor
Frithiof, so devoted to him, that he altogether forgot his specimens
and his microscope. He wondered greatly how many
victims had been sacrificed to Blanche Romiaux’s selfish
love of admiration, and he longed to have her in that room,
and point to the man who tossed to and fro in sleepless
misery, and say to her, “This is what your hateful flirting has
brought about.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the little Norwegian episode had entirely passed out of
Lady Romiaux’s mind. Had she been questioned she would
probably have replied that her world contained too many hard
realities to leave room for the recollection of mere dreams.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dream, however, had gone hard with Frithiof. Sleeping
draughts had no effect on him, and his temperature
remained so high that Dr. Morris began to fear the worst.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy used to be haunted by the thought that he had telegraphed
for Sigrid Falck, and that he should have to meet her
after her long journey with the news that all was over. And
remembering the bright face and sunny manner of the Norwegian
girl, his heart failed him at the thought of her desolation.
But Frithiof could not even take in the idea that she
had been sent for. Nothing now made any difference to him.
Sleep alone could restore him. But sleep refused to come, and
already the death-angel hovered near, ready to give him the
release for which he so greatly longed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Although it was the middle of August, a bitterly cold wind
blew round the dreary little posting station of Hjerkin, on the
Dovrefield, and at the very time when Frithiof lay dying in the
intolerable heat of London, Sigrid, shivering with cold, paced
drearily along the bleak mountain road with her aunt. They
had come to the Dovrefield a fortnight before for the summer
holiday, but the weather had been unfavorable, and away from
home, with nothing very particular to occupy their time, Fru
Grönvold and Sigrid seemed to jar upon each other more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>ever. Apparently the subject they were discussing was not at
all to the girl’s taste, for as they walked along there were two
ominous little depressions in her forehead, nor did her black fur
hat entirely account for the shadow that overspread her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Fru Grönvold emphatically, “I am sorry to
have to say such a thing of you, Sigrid, but it really seems to
me that you are playing the part of the dog in the manger. You
profess absolute indifference to every man you meet, yet you
go on absorbing attention, and standing in Karen’s light, in a
way which I assure you is very trying to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid’s cheek flamed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have done nothing to justify you in saying such a thing,”
she said angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” cried Fru Grönvold. “Did not that Swedish
botanist talk to you incessantly? Does not the English officer
follow you about whenever he has the opportunity?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The botanist talked because we had a subject in common,”
replied Sigrid. “And probably the officer prefers talking to
me because my English is more fluent than Karen’s.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that I suppose was the reason that you must be the
one to teach him the <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">spring dans</span></i>? And the one to sing him
the ‘Bridal Song of the Hardanger’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!” exclaimed Sigrid, with an impatient little stamp of
the foot, “am I to be forever thinking of this wretched scheming
and match-making? Can I not even try to amuse a middle-aged
Englishman who is disappointed of his reindeer, and finds himself
stranded in a dreary little inn with a handful of foreigners?
I have only been courteous to him—nothing more; and if I
like talking to him it is merely because he comes from England.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t wish to be hard on you,” said Fru Grönvold, “but
naturally I have the feelings of a mother, and do not like to see
Karen eclipsed. I accuse you of nothing worse, my dear, than
a slight forwardness—a little deficiency in tact. There is no
occasion for anger on your part.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid bit her lip hard to keep back the retort that she longed
to make, and they walked in silence toward the little cluster of
wooden buildings on the hill-side, the lowest of which contained
the bedrooms, while further up the hill the kitchen and dining-room
stood on one side of the open courtyard, and on the
other the prettily arranged public sitting-room. In warm
weather Hjerkin is a little paradise, but on this windy day,
under a leaden sky, it seemed the most depressing place on
earth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“I shall go in and write to Frithiof,” said Sigrid, at length.
And escaping gladly from Fru Grönvold, she ran up to her room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here we are at Hjerkin,” she wrote, “for a month, and it
is more desolate than I can describe to you, uncle and Oscar
out shooting all day long, and scarcely a soul to speak to, for
most of the English have been driven away by the bad weather,
and two girls from Stockholm who were here for their health
are leaving this afternoon, unable to bear the dullness any
longer. If something doesn’t happen soon I think I shall grow
desperate. But surely something will happen. We can’t be
meant to go on in this wretched way, apart from each other.
I am disappointed that you think there is no chance of any
opening for me in London. If it were not for Swanhild I
think I should try for work—any sort of work except teaching—at
Christiania. But I can’t bear to leave her, and uncle would
object to my trying for anything of the sort in Bergen. I can’t
help thinking of the old times when we were children, and of
the summer holidays then. Don’t you remember when we had
the island all to ourselves, and used to rush down the fir-hill,
and frighten poor old Gro?”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>She stopped writing because the thought of those past days
had blinded her with tears, and because the longing for her
father’s presence had overwhelmed her; they had been so
much to each other that there was not an hour in the day when
she did not miss him. The dreary wind howling and whistling
round the little wooden house seemed to harmonize only too
well with her sadness, and when the unwelcome supper-bell
began to ring she wrapped her shawl about her, and climbed
the steep path to the dining-room, slowly and reluctantly, with
a look on her pale face which it was sad to see in one so young.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild came dancing to meet her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Major Brown has got us such beautiful trout for supper,
Sigrid, and uncle says I may go out fishing, too, some day.
And you’ll come with us, wont you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You had better take Karen,” said Sigrid listlessly. “You
know I never did care much for fishing. You shall catch them
and I will eat them,” she added, with a dreary little smile.
And throughout supper she hardly spoke, and at the first opportunity
slipped away quietly, only, however, to be pursued
by Swanhild.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the matter?” said the child, slipping her arm
round her sister’s waist. “Are you not coming to the sitting-room?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“No,” said Sigrid, “I am tired, and it is so cold in there.
I am going into the kitchen to buy some stamps. Frithiof’s
letter ought to go to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As she spoke she opened the door of the roomy old kitchen,
which is the pride of Hjerkin. Its three windows were shaded
by snowy muslin curtains; its spotless floor was strewn with
juniper; the walls, painted a peacock-blue, were hung with
bright dish-covers, warming-pans, quaint old bellows and
kitchen implements. There was a tall old clock in a black and
gold case, a pretty corner cupboard in shaded brown, and a
huge, old-fashioned cabinet with cunning little drawers and
nooks and corners, all painted in red and blue and green,
with an amount of gilding which gave it quite an Eastern
look.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, how cozy the fire looks!” cried Swanhild, crossing
over to the curious old grate which filled the whole of one
corner of the room, and which certainly did look very tempting
with its bright copper kettles and saucepans all glowing in the
ruddy light.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bless your heart,” said the kind old landlady, “sit down
and warm yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And one of the white-sleeved servant-girls brought a little
chair which stood by a long wooden settle, and put it close by
the fire for the child, and Sigrid, her purchase made, joined
the little group, and sat silently warming her hands, finding a
sort of comfort in the mere physical heat, and in the relief of
being away from her aunt. The landlady told Swanhild stories,
and Sigrid listened dreamily, letting her thoughts wander off
now and then to Frithiof, or back into the far past, or away
into the future which looked so dreary. Still the kindness of
these people, and the interest and novelty of her glimpse into
a different sort of life, warmed her heart and cheered her a
little. Sitting there in the firelight she felt more at home than
she had done for many months.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, Swanhild,” she said at last reluctantly, “it is ten
o’clock, and time you were in bed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And thanking the landlady for her kindness, the two sisters
crossed over the courtyard to the sitting-room, where Fru
Grönvold was watching the progress of a rubber in which Karen
was Major Brown’s partner, and had just incurred his wrath
by revoking.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where in the world have you been?” said Fru Grönvold,
knitting vehemently. “We couldn’t think what had become of
you both.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“I went to the kitchen to get some stamps,” said Sigrid
coldly. She always resented her aunt’s questioning.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And it was so lovely and warm in there,” said Swanhild
gayly, “and Fru Hjerkin has been telling me such beautiful
stories about the Trolds. Her mother really saw one, do you
know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After this a cold good-night was exchanged, and Fru Grönvold’s
brow grew darker still when Major Brown called out in
his hearty way:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What, going so early, Miss Falck? We have missed you
sadly to-night.” Then, as she said something about the English
mail, “Yes, yes, quite right. And I ought to be writing
home, too, instead of playing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That means that he will not have another rubber,” thought
Sigrid, as she hurried down the hill to the <em>dépendence</em>, “and I
shall be blamed for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She fell into a state of blank depression, and long after
Swanhild was fast asleep she sat struggling with the English
letter, which, do what she would, refused to have a cheerful tone
forced into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only comfort is,” she thought, “that the worst has
happened to us; what comes now must be for the better. How
the wind is raging round the house and shrieking at the windows!
And, oh, how dreary and wretched this life is!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And in very low spirits she blew out the candle, and lay down
to sleep as best she might in a bed which shook beneath her in
the gale.</p>

<p class='c000'>With much that was noble in Sigrid’s nature there was interwoven
a certain fault of which she herself was keenly conscious.
She could love a few with the most ardent and devoted love,
but her sympathies were not wide; to the vast majority of
those she met she was absolutely indifferent, and though naturally
bright and courteous and desirous of giving pleasure, yet
she was too deeply reserved to depend at all on the outer circle
of friends; she liked them well enough, but it would not greatly
have troubled her had she never met them again. Very few
had the power to call out all the depths of tenderness, all the
womanly sweetness which really characterized her, while a great
many repelled her, and called out the harder side of her nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was thus with Fru Grönvold. To her aunt, Sigrid was like
an icicle, and her hatred of the little schemes and hopes and
anxieties which filled Fru Grönvold’s mind blinded her to much
that was worthy of all admiration. However, like all the Falcks,
Sigrid was conscientious, and she had been struggling on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>through the spring and summer, making spasmodic efforts to
overcome her strong dislike to one who in the main was kind to
her, and the very fact that she had tried made her now more
conscious of her failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My life is slipping by,” she thought to herself, “and somehow
I am not making the most of it. I am harder and colder
than before all this trouble came; I was a mere fine-weather
character, and the storm was too much for me. If I go on hating
auntie perhaps I shall infect Swanhild, and make her turn
into just such another narrow-hearted woman. Oh, why does
one have to live with people that rub one just the wrong way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She fell asleep before she had solved this problem, but woke
early and with a restless craving, which she could not have explained,
dressed hastily, put on all the wraps that she possessed,
and went out into the fresh morning air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have got to put up with this life,” she said to herself,
“and I shall just walk off this stupid discontented mood. What
can’t be cured must be endured. Oh, how beautiful it is out
all alone in the early morning! I am glad the wind is quite
gone down, it has just cooled the air so that to breathe it is
like drinking iced water. After all, one can’t talk of merely
enduring life when there is all this left to one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the steep high-road, she struck off to the left, intent
on gaining the top of Hjerkinshö. Not a house was in sight,
not a trace of any living being; she walked on rapidly, for,
although the long upward slope was in parts fairly steep, the
gray lichen with which the ground was thickly covered was so
springy and delicious to walk on that she felt no fatigue, the
refreshing little scrunch that it made beneath her feet seemed
in itself to invigorate her. By the time she reached the top of
the hill she was glowing with exercise, and was glad to sit down
and rest by the cairn of stones. All around her lay one great
undulating sweep of gray country, warmed by the bright sunlight
of the summer morning, and relieved here and there by
the purple shadow of some cloud. Beyond, there rose tier
above tier of snowy peaks, Snehaetten standing out the most
nobly of all, and some eighty attendant peaks ranged round
the horizon line as though they were courtiers in attendance
on the monarch of the district. At first Sigrid was so taken up
by this wonderful panorama that she had not a thought for
anything beyond it, but after awhile the strange stillness roused
her; for the first time in her life she had come into absolute
silence, and what made the silence was the infinite space.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If one could always be in a peace like this,” she thought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“surely life would be beautiful then! If one could get out of
all the littleness and narrowness of one’s own heart, and be
silent and quiet from all the worries and vexations and dislikes
of life! Perhaps it was the longing for this that made women
go into convents; some go still into places where they never
speak. That would never suit me; out of sheer perversity I
should want to talk directly. But if one could always have a
great wide open space like this that one could go into when
one began to get cross—”</p>

<p class='c000'>But there all definite thought was suddenly broken, because
nature and her own need had torn down a veil, and there
rushed into her consciousness a perception of an infinite calm,
into which all might at any moment retire. The sense of that
Presence which had so clearly dawned on her on the night of
her father’s death returned to her now more vividly, and for
the first time in her life she was absolutely at rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a time she rose and walked quietly home, full of an
eager hopefulness, to begin what she rightly felt would be a
new life. She stopped to pick a lovely handful of flowers for
her aunt; she smiled at the thought of the annoyance she had
felt on the previous night about such a trifle, and went forward
almost gayly to meet the old troubles which but a few hours
before had seemed intolerable, but now looked slight and easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Sigrid! she had yet to learn that with fresh strength
comes harder fighting in the battle of life, and that of those to
whom much is given much will be required.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were very cheerful that morning at breakfast; Fru
Grönvold seemed pleased with the flowers, and everything went
smoothly. Afterward, when they were standing in a little
group outside the door, she even passed her arm within Sigrid’s
quite tenderly, and talked in the most amiable way imaginable
of the excursion which was being planned to Kongswold.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look! look!” cried Swanhild merrily, “here are some
travelers. Two carioles and a stolkjaerre coming up the hill.
Oh! I hope they will be nice, and that they will stay here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The arrival caused quite a little bustle of excitement, and
many speculations were made as to the relationship of the two
sportsmen and the two ladies in the stolkjaerre. Major Brown
came forward to do the honors of the place, as the landlord
happened not to be at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there any one of the name of Falck here?” asked one of
the travelers as he dismounted from his cariole. “We were at
Dombaas last night and promised to bring this on; we told
the landlord that we meant to sleep at Fokstuen, but he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>there was no quicker way of delivery. Seems a strange mode
of delivering telegrams, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Miss Falck, I see it is for you,” said Major Brown,
glancing at the direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stepped hastily forward to take it from him with flushed
cheeks and trembling hands; it seemed an eternity before she
had torn it open, and the few words within half paralyzed her.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment all seemed to stand still, then she became
conscious of the voices around.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, we were almost blown away at Fokstuen,” said one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But such <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">flatbrod</span></i> as they make there!” said another, “we
brought away quite a tinful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing wrong, my dear, I hope?” said Fru Grönvold.
“Child, child, what is it? Let me read.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came an almost irresistible impulse to burst into a flood
of tears, checked only by the presence of so many strangers,
and by the necessity of explaining to her aunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is in English,” she said in a trembling voice. “From
Mr. Boniface. It says only, ‘Frithiof dangerously ill. Come.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor child! you shall go at once,” said Fru Grönvold.
“What can be wrong with Frithiof? Dangerously ill! See,
it was sent from London yesterday. You shall not lose a moment,
my dear. Here is your uncle, I’ll tell him everything,
and do you go and pack what things you need.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl obeyed; it seemed as if when once she had moved
she was capable only of the one fear—the terrible fear lest she
should miss the English steamer. Already it was far too late
to think of catching the Thursday steamer from Christiania to
London, but she must strain every nerve to catch the next one.
Like one in a frightful dream she hastily packed, while Swanhild
ran to and fro on messages, her tears falling fast, for she,
poor little soul, would be left behind, since it was impossible
that she should be taken to London lodgings, where, for aught
they knew, Frithiof might be laid up with some infectious illness.
In all her terrible anxiety Sigrid felt for the child, and
with a keen pang remembered that she had not set her the best
of examples, and that all her plans for a new life, and for
greater sympathy with her aunt, were now at an end. The old
life with all its lost opportunities was over—it was over, and
she rightly felt that she had failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have murmured and rebelled,” she thought to herself,
“and now God is going to take from me even a chance of
making up for it. Oh, how hard it is to try too late!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have been looking out the routes, dear,” said Fru Grönvold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>coming into the room, “and the best way will be for you
to try for the Friday afternoon boat from Christiania; it generally
gets to Hull a little before the Saturday one from Bergen,
your uncle says.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When can I start?” asked Sigrid eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must start almost at once for Lille-elvedal; it will be
a terribly tiring drive for you, I’m afraid—eighty-four kilometers
and a rough road. But still there is time to do it,
which is the great thing. At Lille-elvedal you will take the
night train to Christiania; it is a quick one, and will get you
there in ten hours, quite in time to catch the afternoon boat,
you see. Your uncle will take you and see you into the train,
and if you like we can telegraph to some friend to meet you at
the Christiania station: the worst of it is, I fear most people
are away just now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I shall not want any one,” said Sigrid. “If only I
can catch the steamer nothing matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And do not worry more than you can help,” said Fru
Grönvold. “Who knows? You may find him much better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They would not have sent unless they feared—” Sigrid
broke off abruptly, unable to finish her sentence. And then
with a few incoherent words she clung to her aunt, asking her
forgiveness for having annoyed her so often, and thanking her
for all her kindness. And Fru Grönvold, whose conscience
also pricked her, kissed the girl, and cried over her, and was
goodness itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the wrench of parting with poor Swanhild, who
broke down altogether, and had to be left in the desolate little
bedroom sobbing her heart out, while Sigrid went downstairs
with her aunt, bade a hurried farewell to Major Brown, Oscar,
and Karen; then, with a pale, tearless face she climbed into
the stolkjaerre, and was driven slowly away in the direction of
Dalen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her uncle talked kindly, speculating much as to the cause
of Frithiof’s illness, and she answered as guardedly as she
could, all the time feeling convinced that somehow Blanche
Morgan was at the bottom of it all. Were they never to come
to the end of the cruel mischief wrought by one selfish woman’s
vanity? One thing was clear to her; if Frithiof was spared to
them she could never leave him again, and the thought of a
possible exile from Norway made her look back lingeringly at
the scenes she was leaving. Snehaetten’s lofty peaks still appeared
in the distance, rising white and shining into the clear
blue sky; what ages it seemed since she had watched it from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Hjerkinshö in the wonderful stillness which had preceded this
great storm! Below her, to the right, lay a lovely, smiling
valley with birch and fir-trees, and beyond were round-topped
mountains, with here and there patches of snow gleaming out of
black, rocky clefts.</p>

<p class='c000'>But soon all thought of her present surroundings was
crowded out by the one absorbing anxiety, and all the more
because of her father’s recent death hope seemed to die within
her, and something seemed to tell her that this hurried journey
would be in vain. Each time the grisly fear clutched at her
heart, the slowness of their progress drove her almost frantic,
and the easy-going people at Dalen, who leisurely fetched a
horse which proved to be lame, and then, after much remonstrance,
leisurely fetched another, tried her patience almost
beyond bearing. With her own hands she helped to harness
the fresh pony, and at the dreary little station of Kroghaugen,
where all seemed as quiet as the grave, she not only made the
people bestir themselves, but on hearing that it was necessary
to make some sort of a meal there, fetched the fagots herself
to relight the fire, and never rested till all that the place would
afford was set before Herr Grönvold.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>At length the final change had been made. Ryhaugen was
passed, and they drove on as rapidly as might be for the last
stage of their journey. At any other time the beautiful fir
forest through which they were passing would have delighted
her, and the silvery river in the valley below, with its many
windings and its musical ripple, would have made her long to
stay. Now she scarcely saw them; and when, in the heart of
the forest, the skydsgut declared that his horse must rest for
half an hour, she was in despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But there is plenty of time, dear,” said her uncle kindly.
“Come and take a turn with me; it will rest you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She paced to and fro with him, trying to conquer the frenzy
of impatience which threatened to overmaster her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See,” he said at length, as they sat down to rest on
one of the moss-covered boulders, “I will give you now, while
we are quiet and alone, the money for your passage. Here is
a check for fifty pounds, you will have time to get it cashed in
Christiania”; then as she protested that it was far too much,
“No, no; you will need it all in England. It may prove a
long illness; and, in any case,” he added awkwardly, “there
must be expenses.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid, with a horrible choking in her throat, thanked him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>for his help, but that “in any case” rang in her ears all through
the drive, all through the waiting at the hotel at Lille-elvedal,
all through that weary journey in the train.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet it was not until she stood on board the <em>Angelo</em> that tears
came to her relief. A great crowd had collected on the quays,
for a number of emigrants were crossing over to England <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</span></i> for America. Sigrid, standing there all alone, watched
many a parting, saw strong men step on to the deck sobbing
like children, saw women weeping as though their hearts would
break. And when the crowd of those left behind on the quay
began to sing the songs of the country, great drops gathered
in her eyes and slowly fell. They sung with subdued voices.
“<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">For Norge, Kjaempers Foderland</span>,” and “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Det Norske Flagg</span>.”
Last of all, as the great steamer moved off, they sung, with a
depth of pathos which touched even the unconcerned foreigners
on board, “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Ja, vi elsker dette landet</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The bustle and confusion on the steamer, the busy sailors,
the weeping emigrants, the black mass of people on shore waving
their hats and handkerchiefs, some sobbing, some singing
to cheer the travelers, and behind the beautiful city of Christiania
with its spires and towers, all this had to Sigrid the
strangest feeling of unreality; yet it was a scene that no one
present could ever forget. Bravely the friends on shore sung
out, their voices bridging over the widening waters of the fjord,
the sweet air well suiting the fervor of the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yes, we love with fond devotion Norway’s mountain domes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rising storm-lashed o’er the ocean, with their thousand homes—</div>
      <div class='line'>Love our country when we’re bending thoughts to fathers grand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to saga night that’s sending dreams upon our land.</div>
      <div class='line'>Harald on its throne ascended by his mighty sword;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hakon Norway’s rights defended, helped by Oyvind’s sword;</div>
      <div class='line'>From the blood of Olaf sainted, Christ’s red cross arose.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But there the distance became too great for words to traverse
it, only the wild beauty of the music floated after the outward-bound
vessel, and many a man strained his ears to listen to
voices which should never again be heard by him on earth, and
many a woman hid her face and sobbed with passionate grief.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On the following Monday afternoon, Roy Boniface, pale and
worn with all that he had been through, paced the arrival platform
at King’s Cross Station. Already the train from Hull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>was signaled and he longed for Sigrid’s advent, yet dreaded
unspeakably the first few moments, the hurried questions, the
sad answers that must follow. The steamer had been hindered
by a fog, and the passengers had not been landed at Hull until
that morning, so that Sigrid had only had time to telegraph the
hour of her arrival, and had been unable to wait for a reply to
tell her of Frithiof’s state. He should have to tell her all—tell
her amid the unsympathizing crowd which jarred upon him
even now; for during the last few days he had lived so entirely
with his patient that the outer world seemed strange to him.
His heart beat quickly as the engine darted into sight and one
carriage after another flitted past him. For a minute he could
nowhere see her; but hastening up the platform, and closely
scanning the travelers, he at length caught sight of the golden
hair and black dress which he had been imagining to himself, and
heard the clear voice saying, with something of Frithiof’s quiet
decision:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a black trunk from Hull, and the name is Falck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy came quickly forward, and the instant she caught sight
of him all her calmness vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof?” she asked, as he took her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is still living,” said Roy, not daring to give an evasive
answer to the blue eyes which seemed to look into his very
heart. Whether she had feared the worst, or had hoped for
better news, he could hardly tell; she turned deathly white, and
her lips quivered piteously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will see to your luggage,” he said; “but before you go to
him you must have something to eat; I see you are quite worn
out with the long journey, and unless you are calm, you will
only agitate him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She did not speak a word, but passively allowed him to take
her to the refreshment-room and get her some tea; she even
made a faint effort to attack the roll and butter which had been
placed before her, but felt too completely tired out to get on
with it. Roy, seeing how matters were, quietly drew the plate
away, cut the roll into thin slices, and himself spread them for
her. It was months since they had parted at Balholm as friendly
fellow-travelers, yet it seemed now to Sigrid the most natural
thing in the world to depend on him, while he, at the first
glimpse of her questioning face, at the first grasp of her hand,
had realized that he loved her. After her lonely journey, with
its lack of sympathy, it was inexpressibly comforting to her to
have beside her one who seemed instantly to perceive just what
she needed. To please him she tried hard to eat and drink,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and before long they were driving to Vauxhall, and all fear lest
she should break down was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” she said at last, “tell me more about his illness.
What brought it on?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The doctor says it must have been brought on by a great
shock, and it seems that he heard very sad news that day of
Lady Romiaux.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew it was that wretched girl in some way,” cried Sigrid,
clenching her hand. “I wish she were dead!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was startled by her extreme bitterness, for by nature she
was gentle, and he had not expected such vehemence from her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is, as Frithiof incessantly says, ‘Worse than dead,’”
replied Roy. “It is a miserable story. Apparently he got
hold of some newspaper, read it all, and was almost immediately
broken down by it. They say he was hardly himself
when he left the shop that night, and the next evening, when I
saw him, I found him delirious.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is his brain that is affected, then?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; he seems to have been out of health for a long time,
but he never would give way. All the troubles of last autumn
told on him, and this was merely, as they say, the last straw.
But if only we could get him any sleep, he might even now
recover.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How long has he been without it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I came to him on Tuesday evening; it was on the Monday
that he read that paragraph, just this day week, and he
has never slept since then. When did my telegram reach you,
by the by?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not until Thursday. You see, though you sent it on Wednesday
morning, yet it had to be forwarded from Bergen, as
we were in an out-of-the-way place on the Dovrefield.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you have been traveling ever since? You must be
terribly worn out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, the traveling was nothing; it was the terrible anxiety
and the slowness of everything that almost maddened one.
But nothing matters now. I am at least in time to see
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the house where he is lodging,” said Roy as the cab
drew up. “Are you fit to go to him now, or had you not better
rest first?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, I must go to him directly,” she said. And,
indeed, it seemed that the excitement had taken away all her
fatigue; her cheeks were glowing, her eyes, though so wistful,
were full of eagerness. She followed him into the gloomy little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>house, spoke a courteous word or two to Miss Charlotte,
stood in the passage to receive her, and then hastily mounted
the stairs, and entered the darkened room where, instead of the
excitement which she had pictured to herself, there reigned an
ominous calm. A hospital nurse, whose sweet, strong face
contrasted curiously with her funereal garments, was sitting
beside the mattresses, which for greater convenience had been
placed on the floor. Frithiof lay in the absolute stillness of
exhaustion, and Sigrid, who had never seen him ill, was for a
moment almost overcome. That he, who had always been so
strong, so daring, so full of life and spirit, should have sunk
to this! It seemed hardly possible that the thin, worn, haggard
face on the pillow could be the same face which had
smiled on her last from the deck of the steamer when he had
started on that fatal visit to the Morgans. He was talking
incoherently, and twice she caught the name of Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If she were here I could kill her!” she thought to herself;
but the fierce indignation died down almost instantly, for all
the tenderness of her womanly nature was called out by
Frithiof’s need.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Try if you can get him to take this,” said the nurse, handing
her a cup of beef-tea.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took it passively, but evidently did not in the least recognize
her. It was only after some time had gone by that
the tone of her voice and the sound of his native tongue
affected him. His eyes, which for so many days had seen
only the phantoms of his imagination, fixed themselves on
her face, and by degrees a light of recognition dawned in
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid!” he exclaimed, in a tone of such relief that tears
started to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>She bent down and kissed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have come to take care of you. And after you have been
to sleep we will have a long talk,” she said gently. “There, let
me make your pillows comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her presence, instead of exciting him to wonder or to ask
questions, acted upon him like a soothing spell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Talk,” he said. “It is so good to hear Norse once
more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will talk if you will try to sleep. I will sit here and say
you some of Björnsen’s songs.” And, with his hand still in
hers, she said, in her quieting voice, “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Jeg har sogt</span>,” and
“Olaf Trygvason,” and “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Prinsessen</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This last seemed specially to please him, and while, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>sixth time, she was repeating it, Roy, who had been watching
them intently, made her a little sign, and, glancing down, she
saw that Frithiof had fallen asleep. No one stirred, for they all
knew only too well how much depended on that sleep. The
nurse, who was one of those cheerful and buoyant characters
that live always in the present—and usually in the present of
others—mused over her three companions, and settled in her
practical mind the best means of relieving Sigrid without disturbing
the patient.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid herself was living in the past, and was watching sadly
enough Frithiof’s altered face. Could he ever again be the
same strong, hardy, dauntless fellow he had once been? She
remembered how in the old days he had come back from
hunting fresh and invigorated when every one else had been
tired out. She thought of his room in the old home in Kalvedalen
with its guns and fishing-tackle, its reindeer skins and
bear skins, its cases of stuffed birds, all trophies of his prowess.
And then she looked round this dreary London room, and
thought how wretched it must have felt to him when night
after night he returned to it and sat working at translations in
which he could take no sort of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Roy, having lived for so many days in that sick-room
with scarcely a thought beyond it, he had now plunged into a
sudden reaction; a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
Sigrid had come, and with one bound he had stepped into
a bright future; a future in which he could always watch the
fair, womanly face now before him; a future in which he should
have the right to serve and help her, to shield her from care
and turn her poverty to wealth. But that last thought brought
a certain anxiety with it. For he fancied that Sigrid was not
without a share of Frithiof’s independent pride. If once she
could love him the question of money could, of course, make
no difference, but he feared that her pride might perhaps make
out of her poverty and his riches a barrier which should shut
out even the thought of love.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of all those who were gathered together in that room, Frithiof
was the most entirely at rest, for at last there had come to his
relief the priceless gift of dreamless and unbroken sleep. For
just as the spiritual life dies within us if we become absorbed
in the things of this world and neglect the timeless calm which
is our true state, so the body and mind sink if they cannot for
brief intervals escape out of the bonds of time into the realms
of sleep. The others lived in past, present, or future, but
Frithiof lay in that blissful state of entire repose which builds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>up, all unconsciously to ourselves, the very fibers of our being.
What happens to us in sleep that we wake once more like new
beings? No one can exactly explain. What happens to us
when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We kneel how weak, we rise how full of power”?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>No one can precisely tell us. But the facts remain. By these
means are body and spirit renewed.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the next day or two Frithiof realized little. To the
surprise and delight of all he slept almost incessantly, waking
only to take food, to make sure that Sigrid was with him, and
to enjoy a delicious sense of ease and relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is out of the wood now,” said Dr. Morris cheerfully.
“You came just in time, Miss Falck. But I will give you one
piece of advice: if possible stay in England and make your
home with him; he ought not to be so much alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think that he may have such an attack again?”
asked Sigrid wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I don’t say that at all. He has a wonderful constitution,
and there is no reason why he should ever break down
again. But he is more likely to get depressed if he is alone,
and you will be able to prevent his life from growing too monotonous.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So as she lived through those quiet days in the sick-room,
Sigrid racked her brain to think of some way of making money,
and searched, as so many women have done before her, the
columns of the newspapers, and made fruitless inquiries, and
wasted both time and money in the attempt. One day Roy,
coming in at his usual hour in the morning to relieve guard,
brought her a fat envelope which he had found waiting for her
in the hall. She opened it eagerly, and made a little exclamation
of disappointment and vexation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Anything wrong?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>She began to laugh, though he fancied he saw tears in her
eyes. “Oh,” she said, “it seems so ridiculous when I had
been expecting such great things from it. You know I have
been trying to hear of work in London, and there was an
advertisement in the paper which said that two pounds a week
might easily be realized either by men or women without interfering
with their present occupations, and that all particulars
would be given on the receipt of eighteen-pence. So I sent
the money, and here is a wretched aluminium pencil in
return, and I am to make this two pounds a week by getting
orders for them.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The absurdity of the whole thing struck her more forcibly
and she laughed again more merrily; Roy laughed too.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you made any other attempts?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes,” said Sigrid, “I began to try in Norway, and even
attempted a story and sent it to one of our best novelists to ask
his opinion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what did he say?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” she said, smiling, “he wrote back very kindly, but
said that he could not conscientiously recommend any one to
write stories whose sole idea in taking up the profession was
the making of money. My conscience pricked me there, and
so I never tried writing again and never will. Then the other
day I wrote to another place which advertised, and got back a
stupid bundle of embroidery patterns. It is mere waste of
money answering these things. They say a woman can earn a
guinea a time by shaving poodles, but you see I have no
experience of poodles,” and she laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy sat musing over the perplexities of ordinary life. Here
was he with more money than he knew what to do with, and
here was the woman he loved struggling in vain to earn a few
shillings. Yet, the mere fact that he worshiped her made
him chivalrously careful to avoid laying her under any obligation.
As far as possible he would serve her, but in this vital
question of money it seemed that he could only stand aside
and watch her efforts. Nor did he dare to confess the truth
to her as yet, for he perceived quite plainly that she was absorbed
in Frithiof, and could not possibly for some time to come
be free even to consider her own personal life. Clearly at
present she regarded him with that frank friendliness which
he remembered well at Balholm, and in his helpfulness had
discerned nothing that need be construed as the attentions of
a lover. After all he was her brother’s sole friend in England,
and it was natural enough that he should do all that he could
for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father and mother come home to-night,” he said at
length, “and if you will allow me I will ask them if they know
of anything likely to suit you. Cecil will be very anxious to
meet you again. Don’t you think you might go for a drive
with her to-morrow afternoon? I would be here with your
brother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I should so like to meet her again,” said Sigrid, “we
all liked her so much last summer. I don’t feel that I really
know her at all yet, for she is not very easy to know, but she
interested me just because of that.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“I don’t think any one can know Cecil who has not lived
with her,” said Roy, “she is so very reserved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; at first I thought she was just gentle and quiet without
very much of character, but one day when we were out
together we tried to get some branches of willow. They were
so stiff to break that I lazily gave up, but she held on to hers
with a strong look in her face which quite startled me, and
said, ‘I can’t be beaten just by a branch.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is Cecil all over,” said Roy, smiling; “she never
would let anything daunt her. May I tell her that you will see
her to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid gladly assented, and the next day both Mrs. Boniface
and Cecil drove to the little house at Vauxhall. Roy brought
Sigrid down to the carriage, and with a very happy, satisfied
feeling introduced her to his mother, and watched the warm
meeting with Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t think what would have become of Frithiof if it had
not been for all your kindness,” said Sigrid. “Your son has
practically saved his life, I am sure, by taking care of him
through this illness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the worst is over now, I hope,” said Mrs. Boniface.
“That is such a comfort.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the first moment Sigrid had fallen in love with the
sweet-natured, motherly old lady, and now she opened all her
heart to her, and they discussed the sad cause of Frithiof’s
breakdown, and talked of past days in Norway, and of the
future that lay before him, Cecil listening with that absolute
command of countenance which betokens a strong nature, and
her companions little dreaming that their words, though eagerly
heard, were like so many sword-thrusts to her. The neat
brougham of the successful tradesman might have seemed prosaic
enough, and an unlikely place in which to find any romance, but
nevertheless the three occupants with their joys and sorrows,
their hopes and fears, were each living out an absorbing life story.
For every heart has its own romance, and whether living in
the fierce glare of a palace, in the whirl of society, in a quiet
London suburb, or in an East-end court, it is all the same.
The details differ, the accessories are strangely different, but
the love which is the great mainspring of life is precisely the
same all the world over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What makes me so miserable,” said Sigrid, “is to feel
that his life is, as it were, over, though he is so young: it
has been spoiled and ruined for him when he is but one-and-twenty.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“But the very fact of his being so young seems to me to
give hope that brighter things are in store for him,” said Mrs.
Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not think so,” said Sigrid. “That girl has taken something
from him which can never come again: it does not seem
to me possible that a man can love like that twice in a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps not just in that way,” said Mrs. Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And besides,” said Sigrid, “what girl would care to take
such love as he might now be able to give? I am sure nothing
would induce me to accept any secondary love of that
kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She spoke as a perfectly heart-whole girl, frankly and unreservedly.
And what she said was true. She never could have
been satisfied with less than the whole; it was her nature to
exact much; she could love very devotedly, but she would
jealously demand an equal devotion in return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Cecil was of a wholly different type. Already love had
taken possession of her, it had stolen into her heart almost unconsciously
and had brought grave shadows into her quiet life,
shadows cast by the sorrow of another. Her notion of love
was simply freedom to love and serve; to give her this freedom
there must of course be true love on the other side, but of
its kind or of its degree she would never trouble herself to
think. For already her love was so pure and deep that it rendered
her almost selfless. Sigrid’s speech troubled her for a
minute or two; if one girl could speak so, why not all girls?
Was she perhaps less truly womanly that she thought less of
what was owing to herself?</p>

<p class='c000'>“It may be so,” she admitted, yet with a latent consciousness
that so infinite a thing as love could not be bound by any
hard and fast rules. “But I cannot help it. Whether it is
womanly or not, I would die to give him the least real comfort.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell Harris to stop, Cecil,” said Mrs. Boniface. “We will
get some grapes for Mr. Falck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And glad to escape from the carriage for a minute, and glad,
too, to be of use even in such a far-off way, Cecil went into the
fruiterer’s, returning before long with a beautiful basket of
grapes and flowers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h2 id='XIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“See what I have brought you,” said Sigrid, re-entering the
sick-room a little later on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof took the basket and looked, with a pleasure which
a few weeks ago would have been impossible to him, at the
lovely flowers and fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have come just at the right time, for he will insist on
talking of all the deepest things in heaven and earth,” said Roy,
“and this makes a good diversion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are from Mrs. Boniface. Is it not kind of her! And
do you know, Frithiof, she and Doctor Morris have been making
quite a deep plot; they want to transplant us bodily to
Rowan Tree House, and Doctor Morris thinks the move could
do you no harm now that you are getting better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His face lighted up with something of its former expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How I should like never to see this hateful room again!”
he exclaimed. “You don’t know how I detest it. The old
ghosts seem to haunt it still. There is nothing that I can bear
to look at except your picture of Bergen, which has done me
more than one good turn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid, partly to keep him from talking<a id='t173'></a> too much, partly because
she always liked to tell people of that little act of kindness,
gave Roy the history of the picture, and Frithiof lay
musing over the curious relative power of kindness and cruelty,
and was obliged, though somewhat reluctantly, to admit to himself
that a very slight act of kindness certainly did exert an
enormous and unthought-of influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Physical disorder had had much to do with the black view
of life which he had held for the last few months, but now
that the climax had been reached and rest had been forced upon
him, his very exhaustion and helplessness enabled him to see a
side of life which had never before been visible to him. He
was very much softened by all that he had been through. It
seemed that while the events of the past year had imbittered
and hardened him, this complete breakdown of bodily strength
had brought back something of his old nature. The bright
enjoyment of mere existence could of course never return to
him, but still, notwithstanding the scar of his old wound, there
came to him during those days of his convalescence a sense of
keen pleasure in Sigrid’s presence, in his gradually returning
strength, and in the countless little acts of kindness which
everybody showed him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>The change to Rowan Tree House seemed to work wonders
to him. The house had always charmed him, and the recollection
of the first time he had entered it, using it as a shelter
from the storm of life, much as Roy and Cecil had used his
father’s house as a shelter from the drenching rain of Bergen,
returned to him again and again through the quiet weeks that
followed. The past year looked now to him like a nightmare
to a man who was awakened in broad daylight. It seemed to
him that he was lying at the threshold of a new life, worn and
tired with the old life, it was true, yet with a gradually increasing
interest in what lay beyond, and a perception that there
were many things of which he had as yet but the very faintest
notion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid told him all the details of her life in Norway since
they had last seen each other, of her refusal of Torvald Lundgren,
of her relations with her aunt, of the early morning on
Hjerkinshö. And her story touched him. When, stirred by
all that had happened into unwonted earnestness, she owned to
him that after that morning on the mountain everything had
seemed different, he did not, as he would once have done,
laughingly change the subject, or say that religion was all
very well for women.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was just as if I had worn a crape veil all my life,” she
said, looking up from her work for a moment with those clear,
blue, practical eyes of hers. “And up there on the mountain
it seemed as if some one had lifted it quite away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her words stirred within him an uneasy sense of loss, a vague
desire, which he had once or twice felt before. He was quite
silent for some time, lying back idly in his chair and watching
her as she worked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid!” he said at last, with a suppressed eagerness in his
voice, “Sigrid, you wont go back again to Norway and leave
me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, dear, I will never leave you,” she said warmly. “I
will try to find some sort of work. To-night I mean to talk to
Mr. Boniface about it. Surely in this huge place there must be
something I can do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is its very hugeness that makes one despair,” said Frithiof.
“Good God! what I went through last autumn! And
there are thousands in the same plight, thousands who would
work if only they could meet with employment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Discussing the vexed question of the unemployed?” said
Mr. Boniface, entering the room in time to hear this last remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Sigrid, smiling. “Though I’m a wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>foreigner come to swell their number. But what can be the
cause of such distress?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think it is this,” said Mr. Boniface, “population goes on
increasing, but practical Christianity does not increase at the
same rate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you what they call a Christian Socialist?” asked
Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; I am not very fond of assuming any distinctive party
name, and the Socialists seem to me to look too much to compulsion.
You can’t make people practical Christians by Act
of Parliament; you have no right to force the rich to relieve
the poor. The nation suffers, and all things are at a dead-lock
because so many of us neglect our duty. If we argued less
about the ‘masses,’ and quietly did as we would be done by to
those with whom life brings us into contact, I believe the distress
would soon be at an end.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean by that private almsgiving?” asked Frithiof.
“Surely that can only pauperize the people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I certainly don’t mean indiscriminate almsgiving,” said
Mr. Boniface; “I mean only this. You start with your own
family; do your duty by them. You have a constant succession
of servants passing through your household; be a friend
to them. You have men and women in your employ; share
their troubles. Perhaps you have tenants; try to look at life
from their point of view. If we all tried to do this the cure
would indeed be found, and the breach between the rich and
poor bridged over.”</p>

<p class='c000'>How simply and unostentatiously Mr. Boniface lived out his
own theory Frithiof knew quite well. He reflected that all the
kindness he himself had received had not tended to pauperize
him, had not in the least crushed his independence or injured
his self-respect. On the contrary, it had saved him from utter
ruin, and had awakened in him a gratitude which would last
all his life. But this new cure was not to depend only on taxation
or on the State, but on a great influence working within
each individual. The idea set him thinking, and the sense of
his own ignorance weighed upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning it chanced that, sitting out in the veranda at
the back of the house, he overheard Lance’s reading-lesson,
which was going on in the morning-room. Sounds of laborious
wrestling with the difficulties of “Pat a fat cat,” and other
interesting injunctions, made him realize how very slow human
nature is to learn any perfectly new thing, and how toilsome
are first steps. Presently came a sound of trotting feet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Gwen! Gwen!” shouted Lance, “come here to us. Cecil
is going to read to us out of her Bible, and it’s awfully jolly!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He heard a stifled laugh from Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Lance,” she said, “Gwen is much too young to care
for it. Come, shut the door, and we will begin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again came the sound of trotting feet, then Cecil’s clear, low
voice. “What story do you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Read about the three men walking in the fender and the
fairy coming to them,” said Lance promptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a fairy, Lance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I mean a angel,” he replied apologetically.</p>

<p class='c000'>So she read him his favorite story of Nebuchadnezzar the
king, and the golden image and the three men who would not
bow down to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see,” she said at the end, “they were brave men;
they would not do what they knew to be wrong. We want
you to grow like them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a silence, broken at last by Lance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will only hammer nails in wood,” he said gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you mean?” asked Cecil, not quite seeing the
connection.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not into the tables and chairs,” said Lance, who had
clearly transgressed in this matter, and had applied the story
to his own life with amusing simplicity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s right,” said Cecil. “God will be pleased if you
try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He can see us, but we can’t see him,” said Lance, in his
sweet childish tones, quietly telling forth in implicit trust the
truth that many a man longs to believe.</p>

<p class='c000'>A minute after he came dancing out into the garden, his
short, sunny curls waving in the summer wind, his cheeks glowing,
his hazel eyes and innocent little mouth beaming with
happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He looks like an incarnate smile,” thought Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then he remembered what Roy had told him of the
father and mother, and he thought how much trouble awaited
the poor child, and felt the same keen wish that Cecil had felt
that he might be brought up in a way which should make him
able to resist whatever evil tendencies he had inherited. “If
anything can save him it will be such a home as this,” he
reflected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as Cecil came out into the veranda, he joined her,
and they walked together down one of the shady garden paths.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I overheard your pupil this morning,” he began, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>laughed together over the child’s quaint remarks. “That was
very good, his turning the story to practical account all by
himself. He is a lucky little beggar to have you for his teacher.
I wonder what makes a child so ready to swallow quite easily
the most difficult things in heaven and earth?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose because he knows he can’t altogether understand,
and is willing to take things on trust,” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If anything can keep him straight when he grows up it will
be what you have taught him,” said Frithiof. “You wonder
that I admit that, and a year ago I couldn’t have said as much,
but I begin to think that there is after all a very great restraining
power in the old faith. The difficulty is to get up any sort of
interest in that kind of thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You talk as if it were a sort of science,” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is precisely what it seems to me; and just as one
man is born with a love of botany, another takes naturally to
astronomy, and a third has no turn for science whatever, but
is fond of hunting and fishing, so it seems to me with religion.
All of you, perhaps, have inherited the tendency from your
Puritan forefathers, but I have inherited quite the opposite
tendency from my Viking ancestors. Like them, I prefer to
love my friend and hate my enemy, and go through life in the
way that best pleases me. I am not a reading man; I can’t
get up the faintest sort of interest in these religious matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are talking of two different things,” said Cecil. “It is
of the mere framework of religion that you are speaking.
Very likely many of us are born without any taste for theology,
or sermons, or Church history. We are not bound surely to
force up an interest in them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then if all that is not religion, pray what is it? You are
not like Miss Charlotte, who uses phrases without analyzing
them. What do you mean by religion?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean knowing and loving God,” she said, after a moment’s
pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her tone was very gentle, and not in the least didactic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have believed in a God always—more or less,” said
Frithiof slowly. “But how do you get to know Him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think it is something in the same way that people get to
know each other,” said Cecil. “Cousin James Horner, for
instance, sees my father every day; he has often stayed in the
same house with him, and has in a sense known him all his
life. But he doesn’t really know him at all. He never takes
the trouble really to know any one. He sees the outside of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>my father—that is all. They have hardly anything in common.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Horner is so full of himself and his own opinions that
he never could appreciate such a man as your father,” said
Frithiof. Then, perceiving that his own mouth had condemned
him, he relapsed into silence. “What is your receipt,
now, for getting to know a person?” he said presently, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“First,” she said thoughtfully, “a desire to know and a
willingness to be known. Then I think one must forget one’s
self as much as possible, and try to understand the feelings,
and words, and acts of the one you wish to know in the light
of the whole life, or as much as you can learn of it, not merely
of the present. Then, too, I am quite sure that you must be
alone together, for it is only alone that people will talk of the
most real things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was silent, trying in his own mind to fit her words to his
own need.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you don’t think, as some do, that when once we set
out with a real desire all the rest is quite easy and to be drifted
into without any special effort.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she said, “I do not believe in drifting. And if we
were not so lazy I believe we should all of us know more of
God. It is somehow difficult to take quite so much pains about
that as about other things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It can’t surely be difficult to you; it always seems to be
easy to women, but to us men all is so different.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you so sure of that?” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have always fancied so,” he replied. “Why, the very idea
of shutting one’s self in alone to think—to pray—it is so utterly
unnatural to a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose the harder it is the more it is necessary,” said
Cecil. “But our Lord was not always praying on mountains;
he was living a quite ordinary shop life, and must have been
as busy as you are.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her words startled him; everything connected with Christianity
had been to him lifeless, unreal, formal—something
utterly apart from the every-day life of a nineteenth century
man. She had told him that to her religion meant “knowing”
and “loving,” and he now perceived that by “loving” she
meant the active living of the Christ-life, the constant endeavor
to do the will of God. She had not actually said this in
so many words, but he knew more plainly than if she had spoken
that this was her meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>They paced in silence the shady garden walk. To Frithiof
the whole world seemed wider than it had ever been before.
On the deadly monotony of his business life there had arisen a
light which altogether transformed it. He did his best even
now to quench its brightness, and said to himself, “This will
not last; I shall hate desk and counter and all the rest of it as
badly as ever when I go back.” For it was his habit since
Blanche had deceived him to doubt the lastingness of all that
he desired to keep. Still, though he doubted for the future,
the present was wonderfully changed, and the new idea that
had come into his life was the best medicine he could have had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid watched his returning strength with delight; indeed,
perhaps she never realized what he had been during his lonely
months of London life. She had not seen the bitterness, the
depression, the hardness, the too evident deterioration which
had saddened Cecil’s heart through the winter and spring; and
she could not see as Cecil saw how he was struggling up now
into a nobler manhood. Roy instinctively felt it. Mr. Boniface,
with his ready sympathy and keen insight, found out
something of the true state of the case; but only Cecil actually
knew it. She had had to bear the worst of the suffering all
through those long months, and it was but fair that the joy
should be hers alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof hardly knew which part of the day was most pleasant
to him, the quiet mornings after Mr. Boniface and Roy had
gone to town, when he and Sigrid were left to their own devices;
the pleasant little break at eleven, when Mrs. Boniface looked
in to remind them that fruit was good in the morning, and to
tempt him with pears and grapes, while Cecil and the two
children came in from the garden, bringing with them a sense
of freshness and life; the drowsy summer afternoon when he
dozed over a novel; the drive in the cool of the day, and the
delightful home evenings with music and reading aloud.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quiet the life was, it is true, but dull never. Every one had
plenty to do, yet not too much, for Mr. Boniface had a horror
of the modern craze for rushing into all sorts of philanthropic
undertakings, would have nothing to do with bazaars, groaned
inwardly when he was obliged by a sense of duty to attend any
public meeting, and protested vehemently against the multiplication
of “Societies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have a pet Society of my own,” he used to say with a
smile. “It is the Keeping at Home Society. Every householder
is his own president, and the committee is formed by
his family.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Notwithstanding this, he was the most widely charitable man,
and was always ready to lend a helping hand; but he loved to
work quietly, and all who belonged to him caught something
of the same tone, so that in the house there was a total absence
of that wearing whirl of good works in which many people live
nowadays, and though perhaps they had not so many irons in
the fire, yet the work they did was better done in consequence,
and the home remained what it was meant to be, a center of
love and life, not a mere eating-house and dormitory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the midst of this home there had come now some strangely
fresh elements. Three distinct romances were being worked
out beneath that quiet roof. There was poor Frithiof with his
shattered life, his past an agony which would scarcely bear
thinking of, his future a desperate struggle with circumstances.
There was Cecil, whose life was so far bound up with his that
when he suffered she suffered too, yet had to live on with a
serene face and make no sign. There was Roy already madly
in love with the blue-eyed, fair-haired Sigrid, who seemed in
the glad reaction after all her troubles to have developed into
a totally different being, and was the life of the party. And
yet in spite of the inevitable pain of love, these were happy
days for all of them. Happy to Frithiof because his strength
was returning to him; because, with an iron resolution, he as
far as possible shut out the remembrance of Blanche; because
the spirit life within him was slowly developing, and for the
first time he had become conscious that it was a reality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Happy for Cecil, because her love was no foolish sentimentality,
no selfish day-dream, but a noble love which taught her
more than anything else could possibly have done; because,
instead of pining away at the thought that Frithiof was utterly
indifferent to her, she took it on trust that God would withhold
from her no really good thing, and made the most of the trifling
ways in which she could at present help him. Happiest
of all perhaps for Roy, because his love-story was full of bright
hope—a hope that each day grew fuller and clearer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Robin,” said Mrs. Boniface, one evening, to her husband,
as together they paced to and fro in the veranda, while Frithiof
was being initiated into lawn-tennis in the garden, “I think
Sigrid Falck is one of the sweetest girls I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So thinks some one else, if I am not much mistaken,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you, too, have noticed it. I am so glad. I hoped it
was so, but could not feel sure. Oh, Robin, I wonder if he has
any chance? She would make him such a sweet little wife!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“How can we tell that she has not left her heart in Norway?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not think so,” said Mrs. Boniface. “No, I feel sure
that can’t be, from the way in which she speaks of her life
there. If there is any rival to be feared it is Frithiof. They
seem to me wrapped up in each other, and it is only natural,
too, after all their trouble and separation and this illness of his.
How strong he is getting again, and how naturally he takes to
the game! He is such a fine-looking fellow, somehow he
dwarfs every one else,” and she glanced across to the opposite
side of the lawn, where Roy with his more ordinary height and
build certainly did seem somewhat eclipsed. And yet to her
motherly eyes that honest, open, English face, with its sun-burned
skin, was perhaps the fairest sight in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not that she was a blindly and foolishly loving mother; she
knew that he had his faults. But she knew, too, that he was a
sterling fellow, and that he would make the woman he married
perfectly happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were so taken up with thoughts of the visible romance
that was going on beneath their eyes, that it never occurred to
them to think of what might be passing in the minds of the
two on the other side of the net. And perhaps that was just
as well, for the picture was a sad one, and would certainly have
cast a shadow upon their hearts. Cecil was too brave and
resolute and self-controlled to allow her love to undermine her
health; nor did she so brood upon her inevitable loss that she
ceased to enjoy the rest of her life. There was very much still left
to her, and though at times everything seemed to her flavorless
and insipid, yet the mood would pass, and she would be able
intensely to enjoy her home life. Still there was no denying
that the happiness which seemed dawning for Roy and Sigrid
was denied to the other two; they were handicapped in the game
of life just as they were at tennis—the setting sun shone full
in their faces and made the play infinitely more difficult,
whereas the others playing in the shady courts had a considerable
advantage over them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, is the set over?” asked Mr. Boniface, as the two girls
came toward them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” cried Sigrid merrily. “And actually our side has
won! I am so proud of having beaten Cecil and Frithiof,
for, as a rule, Frithiof is one of those detestable people who
win everything. It was never any fun playing with him when
we were children, he was always so lucky.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As she spoke Frithiof had come up the steps behind her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“My luck has turned, you see,” he said, with a smile in
which there was a good deal of sadness. But his tone was
playful, and indeed it seemed that he had entirely got rid of
the bitterness which had once dominated every look and
word.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nonsense!” she cried, slipping her hand into his arm.
“Your luck will return; it is only that you are not quite strong
again yet. Wait a day or two, and I shall not have a chance
against you. You need not grudge me my one little victory.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It has not tired you too much?” asked Mrs. Boniface,
glancing up at Frithiof. There was a glow of health in his face
which she had never before seen, and his expression, which had
once been stern, had grown much more gentle. “But I see,”
she added, “that is a foolish question, for I don’t think I have
ever seen you looking better. It seems to me this is the sort
of exercise you need. We let you stay much too long over
that translating in the old days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Sigrid; “I hardly know whether to laugh or
cry when I think of Frithiof, of all people in the world, doing
learned translations for such a man as Herr Sivertsen. He
never could endure sedentary life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And yet,” said Mr. Boniface, pacing along the veranda
with her, “I tried in vain to make him take up cricket. He
declared that in Norway you did not go in for our English
notions of exercise for the sake of exercise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps not,” said Sigrid; “but he was always going in
for the wildest adventures, and never had the least taste for
books. Poor Frithiof, it only shows how brave and resolute he
is; he is so set upon paying off these debts that he will sacrifice
everything to that one idea, and will keep to work which
must be hateful to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is a fine fellow,” said Mr. Boniface. “I had hardly
realized what his previous life must have been, though of
course I knew that the drudgery of shop life was sorely against
the grain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ever since he was old enough to hold a gun, he used to go
with my father in August to the mountains in North Fjord for
the reindeer hunting,” said Sigrid. “And every Sunday
through the winter he used to go by himself on the wildest excursions
after sea-birds. My father said it was good training
for him, and as long as he took with him old Nils, his <span lang="da" xml:lang="da">skydsmand</span>—I
think you call that boatman in English—he was never
worried about him when he was away. But sometimes I was
afraid for him, and old Gro, our nurse, always declared that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>would end by being drowned. Come here, Frithiof, and tell
Mr. Boniface about your night on the fjord by Bukken.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His eyes lighted up at the recollection.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, it was such fun!” he cried; “though we were cheated
out of our sport after all. I had left Bergen on the Saturday,
going with old Nils to Bukken, and there as usual we took a
boat to row across to Gjelleslad where I generally slept, getting
up at four in the morning to go after the birds. Well, that
night Nils and I set out to row across, but had not got far
when the most fearful storm came down on us. I never saw
such lightning, before or since, and the wind was terrific; we
could do nothing against it, and indeed it was wonderful that
we did not go to the bottom. By good luck we were driven
back to land, and managed to haul up the boat, turn it up, and
shelter as best we could under it, old Nils swearing like a
trooper and declaring I should be the death of him some day.
For four mortal hours we stayed there, and the storm still
raged. At last, by good luck, I hunted up four men who were
willing to run the risk of rowing us back to Bergen. Then off
we set, Nils vowing that we should be drowned, and so we were
very nearly. It was the wildest night I ever knew, and the
rowing was fearful work, but at last we got safely home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you should have seen him,” cried Sigrid. “He roused
us all up at half-past six in the morning, and there he was,
soaked to the skin, but looking so bright and jolly, and making
us roar with laughter with his description of it all. And I really
believe it did him good; for after a few hours’ sleep he came
down in the best possible of humors. And don’t you remember,
Frithiof, how you played it all on your violin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And was only successful in showing how well Nils growled,”
said Frithiof, laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reference to the violin suggested the usual evening’s
music, and they went into the drawing-room, where Sigrid
played them some Norwegian airs, Roy standing near her, and
watching her fair, sweet face, which was still glowing with the
recollection of those old days of which they had talked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it possible,” he thought, “that she who was so devoted
to her brother, that she who loved the thought of perilous adventures,
and so ardently admired the bold, fearless, peril-seeking
nature of the old Vikings, was it possible that she
could ever love such an ordinary, humdrum, commonplace
Londoner as himself?” He fell into great despondency, and
envied Frithiof his Norse nature, his fine physique, his daring
spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>How infinitely harder life was rendered to his friend by that
same nature, he did not pause to think, and sorry as he was for
Frithiof’s troubles, he scarcely realized at all the force with
which they had fallen upon the Norwegian’s proud, self-reliant
character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Absorbed in the thought of his own love, he had little leisure
for such observations. The one all-engrossing question excluded
everything else. And sometimes with hope he asked himself,
“Can she love me?”—sometimes in despair assured
himself that it was impossible—altogether impossible.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If any one had told Roy that his fate was to be seriously
affected by Mrs. James Horner, he would scarcely have credited
the idea. But the romances of real life are not as a rule
spoiled by some black-hearted villain, but are quite unconsciously
checked by uninteresting matrons, or prosaic men of
the world, who, with entire innocence, frustrate hopes and in
happy ignorance go on their way, never realizing that they
have had anything to do with the actual lives of those they
meet. If the life at Rowan Tree House had gone on without
interruption, if Sigrid had been unable to find work and had
been at perfect leisure to consider Roy’s wooing, it is quite
probable that in a few weeks their friendship might have ended
in betrothal. But Mrs. James Horner gave a children’s party,
and this fact changed the whole aspect of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is, as you say, rather soon after my poor uncle’s death
for us to give a dance,” said Mrs. Horner, as she sat in the
drawing-room of Rowan Tree House discussing the various
arrangements. “But you see it is dear Mamie’s birthday, and
I do not like to disappoint her; and Madame Lechertier has
taken the idea up so warmly, and has promised to come as a
spectator. It was at her suggestion that we made it a fancy
dress affair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who is Madame Lechertier?” asked Sigrid, who listened
with all the interest of a foreigner to these details.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is a very celebrated dancing mistress,” explained Cecil.
“I should like you to see her, for she is quite a character.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miss Falck will, I hope, come to our little entertainment,”
said Mrs. Horner graciously. For, although she detested
Frithiof, she had been, against her will, charmed by Sigrid.
“It is, you know, quite a small affair—about fifty children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and only from seven to ten. I would not, for the world, shock
the congregation, Loveday, so I mean to make it all as simple
as possible. I do not know that I shall even have ices.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear, I do not think ices would shock them,” said Mrs.
Boniface, “though I should think perhaps they might not be
wholesome for little children who have got heated with dancing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I don’t really think they’ll be shocked at all,” said
Mrs. Horner, smiling. “James could do almost anything before
they’d be shocked. You see, he’s such a benefactor to
the chapel and is so entirely the leading spirit, why, where
would they be without him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Boniface murmured some kindly reply. It was quite
true, as she knew very well. James Horner was so entirely
the rich and generous head of the congregation that everything
had to give way to him, and the minister was not a little
hampered in consequence. It was perhaps the perception of
this which made Mr. Boniface, an equally rich and generous
man, play a much more quiet part. He worked quite as hard
to further the good of the congregation, but his work was
much less apparent, nor did he ever show the least symptom
of that love of power which was the bane of James Horner’s
existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether Mr. Boniface entirely approved of this children’s
fancy-dress dance, Sigrid could not feel sure. She fancied
that, in spite of all his kindly, tolerant spirit, he had an innate
love of the older forms of Puritanism, and that his quiet, home-keeping
nature could not understand at all the enjoyment of
dancing or of character-dresses. Except with regard to music,
the artistic side of his nature was not highly developed, and
while his descent from Puritan forefathers had given him an
immense advantage in many ways, and had undoubtedly
helped to make him the conscientious, liberty loving, God-fearing
man he was, yet it had also given him the Puritan
tendency to look with distrust on many innocent enjoyments.
He was always fearful of what these various forms of amusement
might lead to. But he forgot to think of what dullness
and dearth of amusement might lead to, and had not fully
appreciated the lesson which Englishmen must surely have
been intended to learn from the violent reaction of the Restoration
after the restrictions of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no matters of opinion ever made even a momentary discomfort
in that happy household. Uniformity there was not,
for they thought very differently, and each held fast to his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>view; but there was something much higher than uniformity,
there was unity, which is the outcome of love. Little differences
of practice came from time to time; they went their
various ways to church and chapel on Sunday, and Roy and
Cecil would go to hear Donati at the opera-house, while the
father and mother would have to wait till there was a chance
of hearing the celebrated baritone at St. James’s Hall; but in
the great aims of life they were absolutely united, and worked
and lived in perfect harmony. At length the great day came,
and Mr. Boniface and Roy on their return from town were
greeted by a bewitching little figure on the stairs, with curly
hair combed out to its full length and a dainty suit of crimson
velvet trimmed with gold lace.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, who are you?” said Mr. Boniface, entering almost
unconsciously into the fun of the masquerade.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m Cinderella’s prince,” shouted Lance gleefully, and in
the highest spirits the little fellow danced in to show Frithiof
his get-up, capering all over the room in that rapturous enjoyment
of childhood, the sight of which is one of the purest
pleasures of all true men and women. Frithiof, who had been
tired and depressed all day, brightened up at once when Lance,
who was very fond of him, came to sit on his knee in that ecstasy
of happy impatience which one only sees in children.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the time now?” he asked every two minutes.
“Do you think it will soon be time to go? Don’t you almost
think you hear the carriage coming?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for me,” said Sigrid, “I feel like Cinderella before the
fairy godmother came. You are sure Mrs. Horner will not
mind this ordinary black gown?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, dear, no,” said Cecil. “You see, she herself is in
mourning; and besides, you look charming, Sigrid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The compliment was quite truthful, for Sigrid, in her quiet
black dress, which suited her slim figure to perfection, the
simple folds of white net about her neck, and the delicate
blush roses and maidenhair which Roy had gathered for
her, certainly looked the most charming little woman imaginable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you could come, too,” said Cecil, glancing at Frithiof,
while she swathed the little prince in a thick plaid. “It will
be very pretty to see all the children in costume.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he replied; “but my head would never stand the
noise and the heat. I am better here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall take great care of him,” said Mrs. Boniface;
“and you must tell us all about it afterward. Don’t keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Lance up late if he seems to get tired, dearie. Good-by, and
mind you enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There goes a happy quartet,” said Mr. Boniface, as he
closed the door behind them. “But here, to my way of thinking,
is a more enviable trio. Did you ever see this book,
Frithiof?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Since his illness they had fallen into the habit of calling him
by his Christian name, for he had become almost like one of
the family. Even in his worst days they had all been fond of
him, and now in these days of his convalescence, when physical
suffering had brought out the gentler side of his nature, and
his strength of character was shown rather in silent patience
than in dogged and desperate energy, as of old, he had won all
hearts. The proud, willful isolation which had made his
fellow-workers detest him had been broken down at length,
and gratitude for all the kindness he had received at Rowan
Tree House had so changed him that it seemed unlikely that
he would ever sink again into such an extremity of hard bitterness.
His laughter over the book which Mr. Boniface had
brought him seemed to his host and hostess a promising sign,
and over “Three in Norway” these three in England passed
the pleasant evening which Mr. Boniface had predicted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Sigrid was thoroughly enjoying herself. True,
Mr. and Mrs. Horner were vulgar, and now and then said
things which jarred on her, but with all their failings they had
a considerable share of genuine kindliness, and the very best
side of them showed that night, as they tried to make all their
guests happy. A children’s party generally does call out whatever
good there is in people; unkind gossip is seldom heard
at such a time, and people are never bored, for they are infected
by the genuine enjoyment of the little ones, the dancers
who do not, as in later life, wear masks, whose smiles are the
smiles of real and intense happiness, whose laughter is so inspiriting.
It was, moreover, the first really gay scene which
had met Sigrid’s eyes for nearly a year, and she enjoyed to the
full the quaint little cavaliers, the tiny court ladies, with their
powdered hair and their patches; the Red Riding-hoods and
Bo-Peeps; the fairies and the peasants; the Robin Hoods and
Maid Marians. The dancing was going on merrily when Mme.
Lechertier was announced, and Sigrid looked up with interest
to see what the lady who was pronounced to be “quite a
character” was like. She was a tall and wonderfully graceful
woman, with an expressive but plain face. In repose her expression
was decidedly autocratic, but she had a most charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>smile, and a perfect manner. The Norwegian girl took a great
fancy to her, and the feeling was mutual, for the great Mme.
Lechertier, who, it was rumored, was of a keenly critical disposition,
instantly noticed her, and turned to the hostess with
an eager question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a charming face that golden-haired girl has!” she
said in her outspoken and yet courteous way. “With all her
simplicity there is such a pretty little touch of dignity. See
how perfect her bow is! What is her name? And may I not
be introduced to her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is a friend of my cousin’s,” explained Mrs. Horner,
glad to claim this sort of proprietorship in any one who
had called forth compliments from the lips of so critical a
judge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is Norwegian, and her name is Falck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid liked the bright, clever, majestic-looking Frenchwoman
better than ever after she had talked with her. There
was, indeed, in Mme. Lechertier something very refreshing.
Her chief charm was that she was so utterly unlike any one
else. There was about her an individuality that was really
astonishing, and when you heard her talk you felt the same
keen sense of novelty and interest that is awakened by the first
sight of a foreign country. She in her turn was enchanted by
Sigrid’s perfect naturalness and vivacity, and they had become
fast friends, when presently a pause in the music made them
both look up.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pianist, a pale, worn-looking lady, whose black silk
dress had an ominously shiny back, which told its tale of poverty,
all at once broke down, and her white face touched Sigrid’s
heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think she is faint,” she exclaimed. “Do you think I
might offer to play for her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a kind thought,” said Mme. Lechertier, and she
watched with interest while the pretty Norwegian girl hastened
to the piano, and with a few hurried words relieved the pianist,
who beat a hasty retreat into the cooler air of the hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>She played extremely well, and being herself a born dancer,
entered into the spirit of the waltz in a way which her predecessor
had wholly failed to do. Mme. Lechertier was
delighted, and when by and by Sigrid was released she rejoined
her, and refused to be borne off to the supper-room by Mr.
Horner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” she said; “let the little people be attended to
first. Miss Falck and I mean to have a quiet talk here.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>So Sigrid told her something of her life at Bergen, and of
the national love of music and dancing, and thoroughly interested
her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And when do you return?” asked Mme. Lechertier.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That depends on whether I can find work in England,”
replied Sigrid. “What I wish is to stay in London with my
brother. He has been very ill, and I do not think he ought to
live alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What sort of work do you wish for?” asked Madame
Lechertier.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would do anything,” said Sigrid. “But the worst of it is
everything is so crowded already, and I have no very special
talent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear,” said Madame Lechertier, “it seems to me you
have a very decided talent. You play dance music better than
any one I ever heard, and that is saying a good deal. Why
do you not turn this to account?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think I could?” asked Sigrid, her eyes lighting up
eagerly. “Do you really think I could earn my living by it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel sure of it,” said Madame Lechertier. “And if you
seriously think the idea is good I will come and discuss the
matter with you. I hear you are a friend of my old pupil, Miss
Boniface.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, we are staying now at Rowan Tree House; they have
been so good to us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are delightful people—the father is one of nature’s
true gentlemen. I shall come and see you, then, and talk this
over. To-morrow morning, if that will suit you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid went home in high spirits, and the next day, when as
usual she and Frithiof were alone in the morning-room after
breakfast, she told him of Madame Lechertier’s proposal, and
while they were still discussing the matter the good lady was
announced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, like many people, Madame Lechertier was benevolent
by impulse. Had Sigrid been less attractive, she would
not have gone out of her way to help her; but the Norwegian
girl had somehow touched her heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be a case of ‘Colors seen by candlelight will not
look the same by day,’” she had reflected as she walked to
Rowan Tree House. “I shall find my pretty Norse girl quite
commonplace and uninteresting, and my castle in the air will
fall in ruins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But when she was shown into the room where Sigrid sat at
work, all her fears vanished. “The girl has bewitched me!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>she thought to herself. “And the brother, what a fine-looking
fellow! There is a history behind that face if I’m not
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have just been talking over what you said to me last
night, Madame,” said Sigrid brightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The question is,” said Madame Lechertier, “whether you
are really in earnest in seeking work, and whether you will not
object to my proposal. The fact is that the girl who for some
time has played for me at my principal classes is going to be
married. I have, of course, another assistant upon whom I
can, if need be, fall back; but she does not satisfy me, we do
not work well together, and her playing is not to be compared
to yours. I should only need you in the afternoon, and during
the three terms of the year. Each term is of twelve weeks,
and the salary I should offer you would be £24 a term—£2 a
week, you see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Frithiof!” cried Sigrid, in great excitement, “we
should be able to help Swanhild. We could have her over
from Norway. Surely your salary and mine together would
keep us all?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who is Swanhild?” asked Madame Lechertier.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is our little sister, Madame. She is much younger—only
eleven years old, and as we are orphans, Frithiof and I
are her guardians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Madame Lechertier looked at the two young faces, smiling
to think that they should be already burdened with the cares
of guardianship. It touched her, and yet at the same time it
was almost comical to hear these two young things gravely
talking about their ward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see,” said Frithiof, “there would be her education; one
must not forget that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But at the high schools it is very cheap, is it not, Madame?”
said Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“About ten pounds a year,” said Madame Lechertier.
“What is your little sister like, because if she is at all like
you—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is her photograph,” said Sigrid, unfastening her
writing-case and taking out Swanhild’s picture. “This is taken
in her peasant costume which she used to wear sometimes for
fun when when we were in the country. It suits her very well,
I think.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But she is charming,” cried Madame Lechertier. “Such
a dainty little figure—such well-shaped legs! My dear, I have
a bright thought—an inspiration. Send for your little Swanhild,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and when you come to me each afternoon bring her also
in this fascinating costume. She shall be my little pupil-teacher,
and though, of course, her earnings would be but
small, yet they would more than cover her education at a high
school, and she would be learning a useful profession into the
bargain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She glanced at Frithiof and saw quite plainly that he shrank
from the idea, and that it would go hard with his proud nature
to accept such an offer. She glanced at Sigrid, and saw that
the sister was ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of getting
the little girl to England. Then, having as much tact as kindness,
she rose to go.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will talk it over between you and let me know your
decision,” she said pleasantly. “Consult Mr. and Mrs. Boniface,
and let me know in a day or two. Why should you not
come in to afternoon tea with me to-morrow, for I shall be at
home for once, and can show you my canaries? Cecil will
bring you. She and I are old friends.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When she was gone Sigrid returned to the room with dancing
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is she not delightful!” she cried. “For myself, Frithiof, I
can’t hesitate for a moment. The work will be easy, and she
will be thoroughly kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She has a bad temper,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because no sweet-tempered woman ever had such a straight,
thin-lipped mouth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think you are very horrid to pick holes in her when she
has been so kind to us. For myself I must accept. But how
about Swanhild?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hate the thought for either of you,” said Frithiof moodily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somehow, though his own descent in the social scale had
been disagreeable enough, yet it had not been so intolerable to
him as this thought of work for his sisters.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, Frithiof, don’t go and be a goose about it,” said
Sigrid caressingly. “If we are ever to have a nice, cosy little
home together we must certainly work at something, and we
are not likely to get lighter, or more congenial, or better-paid
work than this. Come, dear, you have got, as Lance would
say, to ‘grin and bear it.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In any case, we must give Swanhild herself a voice in the
matter,” he said at length. “Accept the offer if you like, provisionally,
and let us write to her and tell her about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Very well, we will write a joint letter and give her all sorts
of guardianly advice. But, all the same, you know as well as
I do that Swanhild will not hesitate for a moment. She is
dying to come to England, and she is never so happy as when
she is dancing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof thought of that day long ago, when he had come
home after meeting the Morgans at the Bergen landing quay,
and had heard Sigrid playing as he walked up the garden path,
and had found Swanhild dancing so merrily with Lillo, and the
old refrain that had haunted him then returned to him now in
bitter mockery:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To-day is just a day to my mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>All sunny before and sunny behind,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Over the heather.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When Roy came home that evening the matter was practically
decided. Frithiof and Sigrid had had a long talk in the
library with Mr. and Mrs. Boniface, and by and by in the garden
Sigrid told him gleefully what she called the “good news.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can afford to laugh now at my aluminium pencils and
the embroidery patterns, and the poodle shaving,” she said
gayly. “Was it not lucky that we happened to go to Mrs.
Horner’s party, and that everything happened just as it did?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you really like the prospect?” asked Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed I do. I haven’t felt so happy for months. For
now we need never again be parted from Frithiof. It will be
the best thing in the world for him to have a comfortable little
home; and I shall take good care that he doesn’t work too
hard. Mr. Boniface has been so good. He says that Frithiof
can have some extra work to do if he likes; he can attend
some of your concerts, and arrange the platform between the
pieces; and this will add nicely to his salary. And then, too,
when he heard that I had quite decided on accepting Mme.
Lechertier’s offer, he proposed something else for us too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What was that?” said poor Roy, his heart sinking down
like lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, he thinks that he might get us engagements to play
at children’s parties or small dances. Frithiof’s violin playing
is quite good enough, he says. And don’t you think it would
be much better for him than poring so long over that hateful
work of Herr Sivertsen’s?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy was obliged to assent. He saw only too clearly that to
speak to her now of his love would be utterly useless—indeed,
worse than useless. She would certainly refuse him, and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>would be an end of the pleasant intercourse. Moreover, it
would be far more difficult to help them, as they were now
able to do in various small ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof is rather down in the depths about it,” said Sigrid.
“And I do hope you will cheer him up. After all, it is very
silly to think that there is degradation in any kind of honest
work. If you had known what it was to live in dependence on
relations for so long you would understand how happy I am
to-night. I, too, shall be able to help in paying off the debts!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is her life also to be given up to that desperate attempt?”
thought Roy despondently.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if Sigrid had not been absorbed in her own happy
thoughts, his depression, and perhaps the cause of it, would
have been apparent to her. But she strolled along the garden
path beside him, in blissful ignorance, thinking of a busy, successful
future, in which Roy Boniface played no part at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was his friend, she liked him heartily. But that was all.
Whether their friendship could ever now deepen into love
seemed doubtful.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During the next few days Sigrid was absorbed in deep calculations.
She found that, exclusive of Swanhild’s small earnings,
which would be absorbed by her education and the few
extras that might be needed, their actual yearly income would
be about £150. Frithiof’s work for Herr Sivertsen, and whatever
they might earn by evening engagements, could be laid
aside toward the fund for paying off the debts, and she thought
that they might perhaps manage to live on the rest. Mrs.
Boniface seemed rather aghast at the notion, and said she
thought it impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t suppose that we shall spend as little on food as
Frithiof did when he was alone,” said Sigrid, “for he nearly
starved himself; and I don’t mean to allow him to try that
again. I see that the great difficulty will be rent, for that seems
so high in London. We were talking about it this morning,
and Frithiof had a bright idea. He says there are some very
cheap flats—workmen’s model lodgings—that might perhaps do
for us; only of course we must make sure that they are quite
healthy before we take Swanhild there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Clean and healthy they are pretty sure to be,” said Mrs.
Boniface, “but I fancy they have strict rules which might be
rather irksome to you. Still, we can go and make inquiries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>After all, you would in some ways be better off<a id='t194'></a> than in ordinary
lodgings, where you are at the mercy of the landlady.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So that afternoon they went to an office where they could get
information as to model dwellings, and found that four rooms
could be obtained in some of them at the rate of seven and sixpence
a week. At this their spirits rose not a little, and they
drove at once to a block which was within fairly easy distance
both of the shop and of the rooms in which Madame Lechertier
gave her afternoon dancing-classes.</p>

<p class='c000'>To outward view the model dwellings were certainly not attractive.
The great high houses with their uniform ugly color,
the endless rows of windows, all precisely alike; the asphalt
courtyard in the center, though tidy and clean, had a desolate
look. Still, when you realized that one might live in such
a place for so small a sum, and thought of many squalid
streets where the rental would be twice as high, it was more
easy to appreciate these eminently respectable lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At present we have no rooms to let, sir,” was the answer of
the superintendent to Frithiof’s inquiry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their spirits sank, but rose again when he added, “I think,
though, we are almost certain to have a set vacant before long.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could we see over them?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, the set that will most likely be vacant belongs to a
north-country family, and I dare say they would let you look
in. Here, Jessie, ask your mother if she would mind just
showing her rooms, will you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The child, glancing curiously at the visitors, led the way up
flight after flight of clean stone stairs, past wide-open windows,
through which the September wind blew freshly, then down a
long passage until at length she reached a door, which she
threw open to announce their advent. A pleasant-looking
woman came forward and asked them to step in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll excuse the place being a bit untidy,” she said. “My
man has just got fresh work, and he has but now told me we
shall have to be flitting in a week’s time. We are going to
Compton Buildings in the Goswell Road.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After Rowan Tree House, the rooms, of course, felt tiny,
and they were a good deal blocked up with furniture, to say
nothing of five small children who played about in the kitchen.
But the place was capitally planned, every inch was turned to
account, and Sigrid thought they might live there very comfortably.
She talked over sundry details with the present owner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s but one thing, miss, I complain of, and that is that
they don’t put in another cupboard or two,” said the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>woman. “Give me another cupboard and I should be quite
content. But you see, miss, there’s always a something that
you’d like to alter, go where you will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder,” said Sigrid, “if we took them, whether I could
pay one of the neighbors to do my share of sweeping and
scrubbing the stairs, and whether I could get them to scrub
out these rooms once a week. You see, I don’t think I could
manage the scrubbing very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, miss, there would be no difficulty in that,” said the
woman. “There’s many that would be thankful to earn a little
that way, and the same with laundry work. You wont
find no difficulty in getting that done. There’s Mrs. Hallifield
in the next set; she would be glad enough to do it, I know,
and you couldn’t have a pleasanter neighbor; she’s a bit lonesome,
poor thing, with her husband being so much away.
He’s a tram-car man, he is, and gets terrible long hours week-day
and Sunday alike.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to the good woman’s north-country accent Sigrid had
not been able quite to follow this last speech, but she understood
enough to awaken in her a keen curiosity, and to show
her that their new life might have plenty of human interest in
it. She looked out of one of the windows at the big square of
houses and tried to picture the hundreds of lives which were
being lived in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know, I begin to like this great court-yard,” she
said to Cecil. “At first it looked to me dreary, but now it
looks to me like a great, orderly human hive; there is something
about it that makes one feel industrious.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will settle down here, then,” said Frithiof, smiling;
“and you shall be queen bee.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think it would not hurt Swanhild?” asked Sigrid,
turning to Mrs. Boniface. “The place seems to me beautifully
airy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed,” said Mrs. Boniface, “I think in many ways the
place is most comfortable, and certainly you could not do
better, unless you give a very much higher rent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But nevertheless she sighed a little, for though she admired
the resolute way in which these two young things set to work
to make the best of their altered life, yet she could not help
feeling that they scarcely realized how long and tedious must
be the process of slowly economizing on a narrow income until
the burden which they had taken on their shoulders could
at length be removed. Even to try to pay off debts which
must be reckoned by thousands out of precarious earnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>which would be counted by slow and toilsome units, seemed to
her hopeless. Her kind, gentle nature was without that fiber
of dauntless resolution which strengthened the characters of
the two Norwegians. She did not understand that the very
difficulty of the task incited them to make the attempt, nerved
them for the struggle, and stimulated them to that wonderful
energy of patience which overcomes everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Sigrid, she was now in her element. A true woman,
she delighted in the thought of having rooms of her own to
furnish and arrange. She thought of them by day, she
dreamed of them by night; she pored over store lists and
furniture catalogues, and amused them all by her comments.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beds are ruinously dear,” she said, after making elaborate
calculations. “We must have three really comfortable ones
since we mean to work hard all day, and they must certainly
be new; the three of them with all their belongings will not
leave very much out of twelve pounds, I fear. But then as to
chairs and tables they might well be second-hand, and we
wont go in for a single luxury; it will look rather bare, but
then there will be less trouble about cleaning and dusting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will become such a domestic character that we shant
know you,” said Frithiof, laughing. “What do you think we
can possibly furnish the rooms on?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait a moment and I’ll add up my list,” she said cheerfully.
“I never knew before how many things there were in a
house that one can’t do well without. Now that must surely
be all. No, I have forgotten brushes and brooms and such
things. Now then for the adding up. You check me, Cecil,
for fear I make it too little—this is a terrible moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twenty-eight pounds,” exclaimed both girls in a breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can surely never do it on that?” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems a great deal to me,” said Sigrid; “still, I have
more than that over from uncle’s fifty-pound check, even after
Doctor Morris is paid. No, on the whole, I think we need
not worry, but may spend as much as that with a clear conscience.
The thing I am anxious about is my weekly bill.
Look here, we must somehow manage to live on one hundred
and forty-five pounds a year, that will leave five pounds in case
of illness or any great need. For charity it leaves nothing,
but we can’t give while we are in debt. Two pounds fifteen
shillings a week for three of us! Why, poor people live on
far less.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But then you are accustomed to such a different way of
living,” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“That’s true. But still, I think it can somehow be done.
You must still go on with your sixpenny dinners, Frithiof, for
it will fit in better. Then as you and Swanhild will be out all
day and I am out for a great part of the year in the afternoon,
I think our coals will last well, only one fire for part of the day
will surely not ruin us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me see that neatly arranged paper,” said Frithiof. “I
have become rather a connoisseur in the matter of cheap living,
and you had better take me into your counsels.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t know anything about it,” said Sigrid, laughing.
“Yours was not cheap living but cheap starving, which in the
end is a costly affair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof did not argue the point, having in truth often known
what hunger meant in the old days; but he possessed himself
of the paper and studied it carefully. It contained for him
much more than the bare details, it was full of a great hope, of
an eager expectation, the smallness of each item represented a
stepping-stone in the highway of honor, a daily and hourly
clearing of his father’s name. He looked long at the carefully
considered list.</p>

<p class='c000'>“With a clever manager it will be quite possible,” he said,
“and you are no novice, Sigrid, but have been keeping house
for the last eleven years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“After a fashion,” she replied, “but old Gro really managed
things. However, I know that I shall really enjoy trying my
hand at anything so novel, and you will have to come and see
me very often, Cecil, to prevent my turning into a regular
housekeeping drudge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil laughed and promised, and the two girls talked merrily
together as they stitched away at the household linen, Frithiof
looking up from his newspaper every now and then to listen.
Things had so far brightened with him that he was ready to
take up his life again with patience, but he had his days of depression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>even now, though, for Sigrid’s sake, he tried not to
give way more than could be helped. There was no denying,
however, that Blanche had clouded his life, and though he
never mentioned her name, and as far as possible crowded the
very thought of her out of his mind, resolutely turning to work,
or books, or the lives of others, yet her influence was still
strong with him, and was one of the worst foes he had to fight
against. It was constantly mocking him with the vanity of
human hopes, with the foolishness of his perfect trust which
had been so grossly betrayed; it was an eternal temptation to
think less highly of women, to take refuge in cynical contempt,
and to sink into a hard, joyless skepticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, Sigrid, as his sister, and Cecil, as a perfectly
frank and outspoken friend, were no small help to him
in the battle. They could not altogether enter into his
thoughts or wholly understand the loneliness and bitterness of
his life, any more than he could enter into their difficulties,
for, even when surrounded by those we love, it is almost always
true that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our hermit spirits dwell and range apart.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But they made life a very different thing to him and gave him
courage to go on, for they were a continual protest against that
lowered side of womanhood that Blanche had revealed to him.
One woman having done her best to ruin the health alike of
his body and his soul, it remained for these two to counteract
her bad influence, and to do for him all that can be done by
sisterly love and pure unselfish friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there is one thing more striking to an observer of life than
any other it is the strange law of compensation, and its wholly
unexpected working. We see people whose lives are smooth
and easy rendered miserable by some very trifling cause. And,
again, we see people whose griefs and wrongs are heartrending,
and behold in spite of their sorrows they can take pleasure in
some very slight amusement, which seems to break into their
darkened lives with a welcome brightness enhanced by contrast.
It was thus with Frithiof. He entered, as men seldom
trouble themselves to enter, into all the minutiæ of the furnishing,
spent hours in Roy’s workshop busy at the carpenter’s
bench over such things as could be made or mended, and enjoyed
heartily the planning and arranging which a year ago he
would have voted an intolerable bore.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length the day came when they were to leave Rowan
Tree House. Every one was sorry to lose them, and they felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>going very much, for it was impossible to express how much
those restful weeks had done for them both. They each
tried to say something of the sort to Mr. and Mrs. Boniface,
but not very successfully, for Sigrid broke down and cried, and
Frithiof felt that to put very deep gratitude into words is a
task which might well baffle the readiest speaker. However,
there was little need for speech on either side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And when you want change or rest,” said Mrs. Boniface,
shaking his hand warmly, “you have only got to lock up your
rooms and come down here to us. There will always be a
welcome ready for the three of you. Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let it be your second home,” said Mr. Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil, who was the one to feel most, said least. She merely
shook hands with him, made some trifling remark about the
time of Swanhild’s train, and wished him good-by; then, with
a sore heart, watched the brother and sister as they stepped
into the carriage and drove away.</p>

<p class='c000'>That chapter of her life was over, and she was quite well
aware that the next chapter would seem terribly dull and
insipid. For a moment the thought alarmed her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have I been doing,” she said to herself, “to let this
love get so great a hold on me? Why is it that no other man
in the world seems to me worth a thought, even though he
may be better, and may live a nobler life than Frithiof?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She could not honestly blame herself, for it seemed to her
that this strange love had, as the poet says, “Slid into her soul
like light.” Unconsciously it had begun at their very first
meeting on the steamer at Bergen; it had caused that vague
trouble and uneasiness which had seized her at Balholm,
and had sprung into conscious existence when Frithiof had
come to them in England, poor, heartbroken, and despairing.
The faithlessness of another woman had revealed to her the
passionate devotion which surged in her own heart, and during
these weeks of close companionship her love had deepened
inexpressibly. She faced these facts honestly, with what Mrs.
Horner would have termed “an entire absence of maidenly
propriety.” For luckily Cecil was not in the habit of marshalling
her thoughts into the prim routine prescribed by the
world in general, she had deeper principles to fall back upon
than the conventionalities of such women as Mrs. Horner, and
she did not think it well either willfully to blind herself to the
truth, or to cheat her heart into believing a lie. Quite quietly
she admitted to herself that she loved Frithiof, with a pain
which it was impossible to ignore, she allowed that he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>love her, and that it was quite possible—nay, highly probable—that
she might never be fit to be more to him than a friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here were the true facts, and she must make the best she
could of them. The thought somehow braced her up. Was
“the best” to sit there in her room sobbing as if her heart
would break? How could her tears serve Frithiof? How
could they do anything but weaken her own character and
unfit her for work? They did not even relieve her, for such
pain is to be relieved, not by tears, but by active life. No, she
must just go on living and making the most of what had been
given her, leaving the rest</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“In His high hand</div>
      <div class='line'>Who doth hearts like streams command.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For her faith was no vague shadow, but a most practical reality,
and in all her pain she was certain that somehow this love of
hers was to be of use, as all real love is bound to be. She stood
for some minutes at the open window; a bird was perched on
a tree close by, and she watched it and noticed how, when suddenly
it flew away, the branch quivered and trembled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is after all only natural to feel this going away,” she
reflected. “Like the tree, I shall soon grow steady again.”
And then she heard Lance’s voice calling her, and, going to
the nursery, found a childish dispute in need of settling, and
tiny arms to cling about her, and soft kisses to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, Frithiof and Sigrid had reached the model
lodgings, and, key in hand, were toiling up the long flights of
stone stairs. All had been arranged on the previous day, and
now, as they unlocked their door, the moment seemed to them
a grave one, for they were about to begin a new and unknown
life. Sigrid’s heart beat quickly as they entered the little sitting-room.
The door opened straight into it, which was a
drawback, but Mrs. Boniface’s present of a fourfold Japanese
screen gave warmth and privacy, and picturesqueness, by shutting
off that corner from view; and, in spite of extreme economy
in furnishing, the place looked very pretty. A cheerful crimson
carpet covered the floor, the buff-colored walls were bare
indeed, for there was a rule against knocking in nails, but the
picture of Bergen stood on the mantel-piece between the photographs
of their father and mother, serving as a continual
remembrance of home and of a countryman’s kindness. Facing
the fire was a cottage piano lent by Mr. Boniface for as long as
they liked to keep it, and on the open shelves above a corner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>cupboard were ranged the blue willow-pattern cups and saucers
which Sigrid had delighted in buying.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They were much too effective to be banished to the kitchen,
were they not?” she said. “I am sure they are far prettier
than a great deal of the rare old china I have seen put up in
drawing-rooms.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How about the fire?” said Frithiof. “Shall I light it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; do. We must have a little one to boil the kettle, and
Swanhild is sure to come in cold after that long journey. I’ll
just put these flowers into Cecil’s little vases. How lovely they
are! Do you know, Frithiof, I think our new life is going to
be like the smell of these chrysanthemums—healthy and good,
and a sort of bitter-sweet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never knew they had any smell,” he said, still intent on
his fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Live and learn,” said Sigrid, laughingly holding out to him
the basket of beautiful flowers—red, white, crimson, yellow,
russet, and in every variety.</p>

<p class='c000'>He owned that she was right. And just as with the scent of
violets there always rose before him the picture of the crowded
church, and of Blanche in her bridal dress, so ever after the
scent of chrysanthemums brought back to him the bright little
room and the flickering light of the newly kindled fire, and
Sigrid’s golden hair and sweet face. So that, in truth, these
flowers were to him a sort of tonic, as she had said, “Healthy
and good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should like to come to King’s Cross too,” said Sigrid.
“But perhaps it is better that I should stay here and get things
quite ready. I hope Swanhild will turn up all right. She
seems such a little thing to travel all that way alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had set off, she began with great satisfaction to lay
the table for tea; the white cloth was certainly coarse; but she
had bought it and hemmed it, and declared that fine damask
would not have suited the willow-pattern plates nearly so well.
Then, after a struggle, the tin of pressed beef was opened, and
the loaf and butter and the vases of chrysanthemums put in
their places, and the toast made and standing before the fire to
keep hot. After that she kept putting a touch here and a
touch there to one thing and another, and then standing back
to see how it looked, much as an artist does when finishing a
picture. How would it strike Swanhild? was the thought
which was always with her. She put everything tidy in the
bare little kitchen, where, in truth, there was not one unnecessary
piece of furniture. She took some of Frithiof’s things out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of his portmanteau, and made his narrow little bedroom look
more habitable; and she lingered long in the room with the
two beds side by side, tidying and arranging busily, but running
back into the sitting-room every few minutes to see that
all was well there.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last she heard the door-handle turned, and Frithiof’s voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll find her quite a domesticated character,” he was
saying; and in another minute Swanhild was in her arms, none
the worse for her lonely journey, but very glad to feel her cares
at an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Sigrid!” she cried, with childlike glee; “what a dear,
funny little room! And how cosy you have made it! Why,
there’s the picture of Bergen! and oh, what a pretty-looking
tea-table! I’m dreadfully hungry, Sigrid. I was afraid to get
out of the train for fear it should go on. They seem to go so
dreadfully fast here, everything is in a bustle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You poor child, you must be starving!” cried Sigrid.
“Come and take your things off quickly. She really looks
quite thin and pale, does she not, Frithiof?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced at the fair, merry little face, smiling at him from
under its fringe of golden hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She doesn’t feel so very bony,” he said, laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, and I did eat something,” explained Swanhild.
“There was an old lady who gave me two sandwiches, but
they were so dreadfully full of fat. I do really think there
ought to be a law against putting fat in sandwiches so that you
bite a whole mouthful of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They all laugh, and Frithiof, who was unstrapping the box
which he had carried up, looked so cheerful and bright, that
Sigrid began to think Swanhild might prove a very valuable
little companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think of your new bedroom?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s lovely!” cried Swanhild. “What a funny, round bath,
and such a tiny tin washing-stand, just like the one in the old
doll’s house on three legs. And oh, Sigrid, auntie has sent us
three lovely eider-down quilts as a Christmas present, only she
thought I might as well bring them now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a very merry meal, that first tea in the model lodgings.
Swanhild had so much to tell them and so much to hear, and
they lingered at the table with a pleasant consciousness that
actual work did not begin till the following day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s one thing which we had better make up our minds
to at once,” said Sigrid, when at length they rose. “Since we
have got to wait on ourselves, we may as well try to enjoy it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and get what fun we can out of it. Come, Swanhild, I will wash
the tea-things and you shall dry them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for me,” said Frithiof, suddenly appearing at the
kitchen door in his shirt sleeves, “I am shoe-black to the
establishment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You! oh, Frithiof!” cried Swanhild, startled into gravity.
There was something incongruous in the idea of her big brother
turning to this sort of work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I assure you it is in the bond,” he said, smiling. “Sigrid
is cook and housekeeper; you are the lady-help; and I am
the man for the coals, knives, and boots. Every respectable
household has a man for that part of the work, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” she hesitated; “but you—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She clearly doesn’t think me competent,” he said, laughingly
threatening her with his brush.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Order! order! you two, or there will be teacups broken,”
said Sigrid, laughing. “I believe he will do the boots quite
scientifically, for he has really studied the subject. There,
put the china in the sitting-room, Swanhild, on the corner shelves,
and then we will come and unpack.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By nine o’clock everything was arranged, and they came back
to the sitting-room, where Frithiof had lighted the pretty little
lamp, and was writing to Herr Sivertsen to say he would be
glad of more work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come,” said Sigrid, “the evening wont be complete without
some music, and I am dying to try that piano. What shall
be the first thing we play in our new home, Swanhild?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘For Norge,’” said the little girl promptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know we had quite a discussion about that at
Rowan Tree House the other night,” said Sigrid. “They
were all under the impression that it was an English air, and
only knew it as a glee called “The Hardy Norseman.” Mr.
Boniface calls Frithiof his Hardy Norseman because he got
well so quickly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come and sing, Frithiof, do come,” pleaded Swanhild,
slipping her hand caressingly into his and drawing him toward
the piano. And willingly enough he consented, and in their
new home in this foreign land they sang together the stirring
national song—</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, she is charming, your little Swanhild! She is a
born dancer and catches up everything with the greatest ease,”
said Madame Lechertier one autumn afternoon, when Sigrid
at the usual time entered the big, bare room where the classes
were held. She was dressed at madame’s request in her pretty
peasant costume, and Swanhild, also, had for the first time
donned hers, which, unlike Sigrid’s, was made with the shortest
of skirts, and, as Madame Lechertier said, would prove an
admirable dress for a pupil teacher.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think she will really be of use to you, Madame?”
asked Sigrid, glancing to the far end of the big room, where
the child was, for her own amusement, practicing a step which
she had just learnt. “If she is no good we should not of
course like her to take any money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” said Madame Lechertier, patting her on the
shoulder caressingly. “You are independent and proud, I
know it well enough. But I assure you, Swanhild will be a
first-rate little teacher, and I am delighted to have her. There
is no longer any need for her to come to me every morning,
for I have taught her all that she will at present need, and no
doubt you are in a hurry for her to go on with her ordinary
schooling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have arranged for her to go to a high school, in the
mornings, after Christmas,” said Sigrid, “and she must, till
then, work well at her English or she will not take a good
place. It will be a very busy life for her, but then we are all
of us strong and able to get through a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And her work with me is purely physical and will not overtask
her,” said Madame, glancing with approving eyes at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>pretty little figure at the end of the room. “Dear little soul!
she has the most perfect manners I ever saw in a child! Her
charm to me is that she is so bright and unaffected. What is
it, I wonder, that makes you Norwegians so spontaneous? so
perfectly simple and courteous?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In England,” said Sigrid, “people seem to me to have two
sides, a rough home side, and a polite society side. The Bonifaces
reverse the order and keep their beautiful side for home
and a rather shy side for society, but still they, like all the
English people I have met, have distinctly two manners. In
Norway there is nothing of that. I think perhaps we think
less about the impression we are making; and I think Norwegians
more naturally respect each other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was quite right; it was this beautiful respect, this reverence
for the rights and liberties of each other, that made the
little home in the model lodgings so happy; while her own
sunny brightness and sweetness of temper made the atmosphere
wholesome. Frithiof, once more amid congenial surroundings,
seemed to regain his native courtesy, and though
Mr. Horner still disliked him, most of those with whom he
daily came in contact learnt at any rate to respect him, and
readily forgave him his past pride and haughtiness when they
learnt how ill he had been and saw what a change complete
recovery had wrought in him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild prospered well on that first Saturday afternoon,
and Madame Lechertier was quite satisfied with her little idea
as to the Norwegian costumes; the pretty foreigner at the
piano, and the dainty little Norse girl who danced so bewitchingly,
caused quite a sensation in the class, and the two sisters
went home in high spirits, delighted to have pleased their kind-hearted
employer. They had only just returned and taken off
their walking things when there came a loud knock at the
door. Swanhild still in her Hardanger dress ran to see what
was wanted, and could hardly help laughing at the funny-looking
old man who inquired whether Frithiof were in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Still out, you say,” he panted; “very provoking. I specially
wanted to see him on a matter of urgency.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you not come in and wait?” said the child. “Frithiof
will soon be home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” said old Herr Sivertsen. “These stairs are
terrible work. I shall be glad not to have to climb them
again. But houses are all alike in London—all alike!
Story after story, till they’re no better than the Tower of
Babel.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Sigrid came forward with her pretty, bright greeting and
made the old man sit down by the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof has gone for a walk with a friend of his,” she
explained. “But he will be home in a few minutes. I
always persuade him to take a good walk on Saturday if
possible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In consequence of which he doesn’t get through half as
much work for me,” said Herr Sivertsen. “However, you are
quite right. He needed more exercise. Is he quite well
again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite well, thank you; though I suppose he will never be
so strong as he once was,” she said a little sadly. “You see,
overwork and trouble and poor living must in the long run
injure even a strong man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are no strong men nowadays, it seems to me,” said
the old author gruffly. “They all knock up sooner or later—a
degenerate race—a worthless generation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, the doctor says he must have had a very fine constitution
to have recovered so fast,” said Sigrid. “Still, I feel
rather afraid sometimes of his doing too much again. Were
you going to suggest some more work for him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I was; but perhaps it is work in which you could
help him,” said Herr Sivertsen, and he explained to her his
project.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If only I could make time for it,” she cried. “But you
see we all have very busy lives. I have to see to the house
almost entirely, and there is always either mending or making
in hand. And Swanhild and I are out every afternoon at
Madame Lechertier’s academy. By the by, that is why we
have on these peasant costumes, which must have surprised
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a pretty dress, and takes me back to my old days at
home,” said Herr Sivertsen. “As to the work, do what you
can of it, there is no immediate hurry. Here comes your
brother!” and the old man at once button-holed Frithiof, while
Roy, who had returned with him, was ready enough to talk
with Sigrid as she stood by the fire making toast, little Swanhild
in the mean time setting the table for afternoon tea, lighting
the lamp, and drawing the curtains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Herr Sivertsen found himself drinking tea before he knew
what he was about, and the novelty of the little household quite
shook him out of his gruff surliness. Strange bygone memories
came floating back to him as he listened to the two girls’
merry talk, watched them as suddenly they broke into an impromptu
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>dance, and begged them to sing to him the old tunes
which for so many years he had not heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sorry to say,” observed Sigrid, laughing, “that our
next-door neighbor, Mrs. Hallifield, tells me the general belief
in the house is that we belong to the Christy Minstrels. English
people don’t seem to understand that one can dance and
sing at home for pure pleasure and not professionally.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After that the old author often paid them a visit, and they
learned to like him very much and to enjoy his tirades against
the degenerate modern race. And thus with hard work, enlivened
now and then by a visit to Rowan Tree House, or by
a call from the Bonifaces, the winter slipped by, and the trees
grew green once more, and they were obliged to own that even
this smoky London had a beauty all its own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you ever see anything so lovely as all this pink may
and yellow laburnum?” cried Sigrid, as one spring evening
she and Frithiof walked westward to fulfill one of the evening
engagements to which they had now become pretty well accustomed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; we had nothing equal to this at Bergen,” he admitted,
and in very good spirits they walked on, past the great wealthy
houses; he with his violin-case, and she with a big roll of
music, well content with the success they had worked hard to
win, and not at all disposed to envy the West End people. It
was indeed a great treat to Sigrid to have a glimpse of so different
a life. She had toiled so often up the long stone stairs,
that to be shown up a wide, carpeted staircase, into which one’s
feet seemed to sink as into moss, was a delightful change, and
snugly ensconced in her little corner behind the piano, she
liked to watch the prettily decorated rooms and the arrival of
the gayly dressed people. Frithiof, who had at first greatly
disliked this sort of work, had become entirely accustomed to
it: it no longer hurt his pride, for Sigrid had nearly succeeded
in converting him to her doctrine, that a noble motive ennobles
any work; and if ever things annoyed him or chafed his independence,
he thought of the debts at Bergen, and was once
more ready to endure anything. This evening he happened to
be particularly cheerful; things had gone well lately at the
shop; his health was increasing every day, and the home atmosphere
had done a great deal to banish the haunting thoughts
of the past which in solitude had so preyed on his mind.
They discussed the people in Norwegian during the intervals,
and in a quiet way were contriving to get a good deal of fun
out of the evening, when suddenly their peace was invaded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the unexpected sight of the very face which Frithiof had so
strenuously tried to exile from his thoughts. They had just
finished a waltz. Sigrid looked up from her music and saw,
only a few yards distant from her, the pretty willowy figure,
the glowing face and dark eyes and siren-like smile of Lady
Romiaux. For a moment her heart seemed to stop beating,
then with a wild hope that possibly Frithiof might not have
noticed her, she turned to him with intense anxiety. But his
profile looked as though it were carved in white stone, and she
saw only too plainly that the hope was utterly vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof,” she said in Norwegian, “you are faint. Go out
into the cool and get some water before the next dance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed to hear her voice, but not to take in her words;
there was a dazed look in his face, and such despair in his eyes
that her heart failed her. All the terrible dread for his health
again returned to her. It seemed as if nothing could free him
from the fatal influence which Blanche had gained over him.</p>

<p class='c000'>How she longed to get up and rush from the house! How
she loathed that woman who stood flirting with the empty-headed
man standing at her side! If it had not been for her
perfidy how different all might now be!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t help hating her!” thought poor Sigrid. “She has
ruined Frithiof’s life, and now in one moment has undone the
work of months. She brought about my father’s failure; if
she had been true we should not now be toiling to pay off these
terrible debts—hundreds of homes in Bergen would have been
saved from a cruel loss—and he—my father—he might have
been alive and well! How can I help hating her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>At that moment Blanche happened to catch sight of them.
The color deepened in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have they come to that?” she thought. “Oh, poor things!
How sorry I am for them! Papa told me Herr Falck had
failed; but to have sunk so low! Well, since they lost all
their money it was a mercy that all was over between us. And
yet, if I had been true to him—”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her companion wondered what made her so silent all at
once. But in truth poor Blanche might well be silent, for into
her mind there flashed a dreadful vision of past sins; standing
there in the ball-room in her gay satin dress and glittering diamonds,
there had come to her, almost for the first time, a sense
of responsibility for the evil she had wrought. It was not
Frithiof’s life alone that she had rendered miserable. She had
sinned far more deeply against her husband, and though in a
sort of bravado she tried to persuade herself that she cared for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>nothing, and accepted the invitations sent her by the people
who would still receive her at their houses, she was all the time
most wretched. So strangely had good and evil tendencies
been mingled in her nature that she caught herself wondering
sometimes whether she really was one woman; she had her
refined side and her vulgar side; she could be one day tender-hearted
and penitent, and the next day a hard woman of the
world; she could at one time be the Blanche of that light-hearted
Norwegian holiday, and at another the Lady Romiaux
of notoriety.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How extraordinary that I should chance to meet my Viking
here!” she thought to herself. “How very much older
he looks! How very much his face has altered! One would
have thought that to come down in the world would have cowed
him a little; but it seems somehow to have given him dignity.
I positively feel afraid of him. I, who could once turn him
round my finger—I, for whom he would have died! How
ridiculous of me to be afraid! After all, I could soon get my
old power over him if I chose to try. I will go and speak to
them; it would be rude not to notice them in their new position,
poor things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With a word of explanation to her partner she hastily crossed
over to the piano. But when she met Frithiof’s eyes her heart
began to beat painfully, and once more the feeling of fear returned
to her. He looked very grave, very sad, very determined.
The greeting which she had intended to speak died
away on her lips; instead, she said, rather falteringly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you tell me the name of the last waltz?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He bowed, and began to turn over the pile of music to find
the piece.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof,” she whispered, “have you forgotten me? Have
you nothing to say to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>But he made as though he did not hear her, gravely handed
her the music, then, turning away, took up his violin and signed
to Sigrid to begin the next dance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Blanche was eagerly claimed by her next partner, and
with burning cheeks and eyes bright with unshed tears, was
whirled off though her feet seemed weighted and almost refused
to keep time with that violin whose tones seemed to tear her
heart. “I have no longer any power over him,” she thought.
“I have so shocked and disgusted him that he will not even
recognize me—will not answer me when I speak to him! How
much nobler he is than these little toads with whom I have to
dance, these wretches who flatter me, yet all the time despise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>me in their hearts! Oh, what a fool I have been to throw away
a heart like that, to be dazzled by a mere name, and, worst of
all, to lose not only his love but his respect! I shall see his
face in a moment as we go past that corner. There he is!
How sad and stern he looks, and how resolutely he goes on
playing! I shall hate this tune all my life long. I have nothing
left but the power to give him pain—I who long to help
him, who am tortured by this regret!”</p>

<p class='c000'>All this time she was answering the foolish words of her
partner at random. And the evening wore on, and she laughed
mechanically and talked by rote, and danced, oh, how wearily!
thinking often of a description of the Inferno she had lately
seen in one of the magazines, in which the people were obliged
to go on pretending to amuse themselves, and dancing, as she
now danced, when they only longed to lie down and die.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, after all, I can stop,” she reflected. “I am not in the
Inferno yet—at least I suppose not, though I doubt if it can be
much worse than this. How pretty and innocent that little
fair-haired girl looks—white net and lilies of the valley; I
should think it must be her first dance. Will she ever grow
like me, I wonder? Perhaps some one will say to her, ‘That
is the celebrated Lady Romiaux.’ Perhaps she will read the
newspapers when the case comes on, as it must come soon.
They may do her terrible harm. Oh, if only I could undo the
past! I never thought of all this at the time. I never thought
till now of any one but myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That thought of the possibility of stopping the dismal mockery
of enjoyment came to her again, and she eagerly seized the
first opportunity of departure; but when once the strain of the
excitement was over her strength all at once evaporated. Feeling
sick and faint, she lay back in a cushioned chair in the
cloak-room; her gold plush mantle and the lace mantilla which
she wore on her head made her look ghastly pale, and the maid
came up to her with anxious inquiries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is nothing but neuralgia,” she replied wearily. “Let
them call my carriage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then came a confused sound of wheels outside in the
street and shouts echoing through the night, while from above
came the sound of the dancers, and that resolute, indefatigable
violin still going on with the monotonous air of “Sir Roger de
Coverley,” as though it were played by a machine rather than
by a man with a weary head and a heavy heart. Blanche
wandered back to recollections of Balholm; she saw that merry
throng in the inn parlor, she saw Ole Kvikne with his kindly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>smile, and Herr Falck with his look of content, and she flew
down the long lines of merry dancers once more to meet
Frithiof—the boyish, happy-looking Frithiof with whom she
had danced “Sir Roger” two years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lady Romiaux’s carriage is at the door,” said a voice, and
she hastily got up, made her way through the brightly lighted
hall, and with a sense of relief stepped into her brougham.
Still the violin played on, its gay tune ringing out with that
strange sadness which dance music at a distance often suggests.
Blanche could bear it no longer; she drew up the carriage
window, sank back into the corner, and broke into a passionate
fit of weeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quite possible for Lady Romiaux to go, but the dance
was not yet over, and Frithiof and Sigrid had, of course, to
stay to the bitter end. Sigrid, tired as she was herself, had
hardly a thought for anything except her twin. As that long,
long evening wore on it seemed to her that if possible she
loved him better than she had ever done before; his quiet
endurance appealed to her very strongly, but for his sake she
eagerly wished for the end, for she saw by the look of his forehead
that one of his worst headaches had come on.</p>

<p class='c000'>And at length the programme had been toiled through. She
hurried downstairs to put on her cloak and hat, rejoining
Frithiof in a few minutes in the crowded hall, where he stood
looking, to her fond fancy, a thousand times nobler and grander
than any of the other men about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a sigh of relief as they passed from the heated
atmosphere of the house into the cool darkness without. The
stars were still visible, but faint tokens of the coming dawn
were already to be seen in the eastern sky. The stillness was
delightful after the noise of the music and dancing, which had
so jarred upon him; but he realized now how great the strain
had been, and even out here in the quiet night it seemed to
him that shadowy figures were being whirled past him, and that
Blanche’s eyes were still seeking him out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very tired?” asked Sigrid, slipping her arm into his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, tired to death,” he said. “It is humiliating for a
fellow to be knocked up by so little.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not call it ‘little,’” she said eagerly. “You know quite
well it was neither the heat nor the work which tired you. Oh,
Frithiof, how could that woman dare to speak to you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush!” he said sadly. “Talking only makes it worse. I
wish you would drive the thought out of my head with something
else. Say me some poetry—anything.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“I hardly know what I can say unless it is an old poem that
Cecil gave me when we were at Rowan Tree House, but I don’t
think it is in your style quite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Anything will do,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you shall have it then; it is an old fourteenth-century
hymn.” And in her clear voice she repeated the
following lines as they walked home through the deserted
streets:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>He made no comment at all when she had ended the poem,
but in truth it had filled his mind with other thoughts. And
the dim, dreary streets through which they walked, and the
gradually increasing light in the east, seemed like a picture of
his own life, for there dawned for him in his sadness a clearer
revelation of the Unseen than had ever before been granted
him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to Sigrid that she had hardly gone to bed before
it was time to get up again; she sleepily wished that Londoners
would give dances at more reasonable hours, then, remembering
all that had happened, she forgot her own weariness and
turned with an eager question to Swanhild. It was the little
sister’s daily duty to go in and wake Frithiof up, a task of some
difficulty, for either his bad habit of working at night during
his lonely year in town, or else his illness, had left him with a
tendency to be wide awake between twelve and two and sound
asleep between six and seven.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You haven’t called him yet, have you?” asked Sigrid, rubbing
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, but it is quite time,” said Swanhild, shutting up her
atlas and rearing up in the bed where she had been luxuriously
learning geography.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, leave him a little longer,” said Sigrid. “We were so
late last night, and his head was so bad, that I don’t suppose
he has had much sleep. And, Swanhild, whatever you do,
don’t speak of the dance to him or ask him any questions. As
ill luck would have it Lady Romiaux was there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Swanhild was a very imaginative child, and she was
just at the age when girls form extravagant adorations for
women. At Balholm she had worshiped Blanche; even when
told afterward how badly Frithiof had been treated her love
had not faltered, she had invented every possible excuse for
her idol, and though never able to speak of her, still cherished
a little hoard of souvenirs of Balholm. There is something
laughable and yet touching in these girlish adorations, and as
safeguards against premature thoughts of real love they are
certainly worthy of all encouragement. Men were at present
nothing at all to her but a set of big brothers, who did well
enough as playfellows. All the romance of her nature was
spent on an ideal Blanche—how unlike the real Lady Romiaux
innocent Swanhild never guessed. While the world talked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>hard things, this little Norwegian girl was secretly kissing a fir-cone,
which Blanche had once picked up on their way to the
priest’s <em>saeter</em>, or furtively unwrapping a withered rose which
had been fastened in Blanche’s hair at the merry dance on that
Saturday night. Her heart beat so fast that she felt almost
choked when Sigrid suddenly mentioned Lady Romiaux’s name.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How was she looking?” she asked, turning away her
blushing face with the most comical parody of a woman’s innate
tendency to hide her love.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, she was looking just as usual, as pretty, and as siren-like
as ever, wretched woman!” Then, remembering that
Swanhild was too young to hear all the truth, she suddenly
drew up. “But there, don’t speak of her any more. I never
wish to hear her name again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Swanhild sighed; she thought Sigrid very hard and
unforgiving, and this made her cling all the more to her beloved
ideal; it was true she had been faithless to Frithiof, but
no doubt she was very sorry by this time, and as the child
knelt down to say her morning prayers she paused long over
the petition for “Blanche,” which for all this time had never
been omitted once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof came to breakfast only a few minutes before the
time when he had to start for business. His eyes looked very
heavy, and his face had the pale, set look which Sigrid had
learnt to interpret only too well. She knew that while they
had been sleeping he had been awake, struggling with those
old memories which at times would return to him; he had conquered,
but the conquest had left him weary, and exhausted
and depressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If only she had been true to him!” thought Swanhild.
“Poor Blanche! if he looked at all like this last night how terribly
sorry she must have felt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, the child with her warm-hearted forgiveness, and
her scanty knowledge of facts, was perhaps a good deal nearer
the truth than Sigrid. Certainly Blanche was not the ideal of
her dreams, but she was very far from being the hopelessly depraved
character that Sigrid deemed her; she was a woman
who had sinned very deeply, but she was not utterly devoid of
heart, and there were gleams of good in her to which the Norwegian
girl, in her hot indignation, was altogether blind.
Sigrid was not faultless, and as with Frithiof, so there lingered
too with her a touch of the fierce, unforgiving spirit which had
governed their Viking ancestors.</p>

<p class='c000'>More than once that morning as she moved about her household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>tasks she said under her breath—“I wish that woman
were dead!—I wish she were dead!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t look well this morning, Mr. Falck,” said the
foreman, a cheerful, bright-eyed, good-hearted old man, who
had managed to bring up a large family on his salary, and to
whom Frithiof had often applied for advice on the subject of
domestic economy. The two liked each other now cordially,
and worked well together, Foster having altogether lost the
slight prejudice he had at first felt against the foreigner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were up late last night,” said Frithiof, by way of explanation.
But the old man was shrewd and quick-sighted, and
happening later on to be in Mr. Boniface’s private room, he
seized the opportunity to remark:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall have Mr. Falck knocking up again, sir, if I’m not
mistaken: he is looking very ill to-day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Mr. Boniface. “You were
quite right to tell me, Foster. We will see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the foreman knew that there was no favoritism in this
speech, for Mr. Boniface considered the health of his employees
as a matter of the very highest importance, and being a
Christian first and a tradesman afterward, did not consider
money-making to be the great object of life. Many a time
good old Foster himself had been sent down for a few days at
the seaside with his family, and it was perhaps a vivid remembrance
of the delights of West Codrington that made him add
as he left the room:</p>

<p class='c000'>“He looks to me, sir, as if he needed bracing up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Boniface was much of the same opinion when he noticed
Frithiof later on in the day. A thoroughly good salesman the
Norwegian had always been—clear-headed, courteous, and accurate;
but now the look of effort which he had borne for
some time before his illness was clearly visible, and Mr. Boniface
seized the first chance he could get of speaking to him
alone. About five o’clock there came a lull in the tide of customers;
Darnell, the man at the opposite counter, had gone to
tea, and Frithiof had gone back to his desk to enter some songs
in the order-list.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof,” said Mr. Boniface, coming over to him and
dropping the somewhat more formal style of address which he
generally used toward him during business hours, “you have
got one of your bad headaches.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied the Norwegian candidly, “but it is not a disabling
one. I shall get through all right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What plans have you made for your Whitsuntide holiday?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“I don’t think we had made any plan at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I want you all to come away with us for a few days,”
said the shop-owner. “You look to me as if you wanted rest.
Come to us for a week; I will arrange for your absence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very good,” said Frithiof warmly. “But indeed
I would rather only take the general holiday of Saturday to
Tuesday. I am not in the least ill, and would rather not take
extra days when there is no need.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Independent as ever,” said Mr. Boniface, with a smile.
“Well, it must be as you like. We will see what the three
days will do for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Where and how this holiday was to be spent only Mr. and
Mrs. Boniface knew, and Cecil and Roy were as much astonished
as any one when, at two o’clock on Saturday afternoon,
a coach and four stopped at the gate of Rowan Tree House.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! are we to drive there?” asked Cecil. “Oh, father,
how delightful! Will it be very far?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, a long drive; so keep out plenty of wraps, in case the
evening is chilly. We can tuck away the children inside if they
get tired. Now, are we all ready? Then we will drive to the
model lodgings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So off they started, a very merry party, but still merrier when
the three Norwegians had joined them, the girls, as usual,
dressed in black, for economy’s sake, but wearing very dainty
little white sailor hats, which Sigrid had sat up on the previous
night to trim. She enjoyed her new hat amazingly; she enjoyed
locking up the lodgings and handing the key to the caretaker;
she enjoyed the delicious prospect of three days’ immunity
from cooking, and cleaning, and anxious planning of
food and money; and she enjoyed Roy’s presence, with the
frank, free happiness of a girl who is as yet quite heart-whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel like the ‘linen-draper bold,’ in the ballad,” said Mr.
Boniface, with his hearty laugh. “But I have taken precautions,
you see, against a similar catastrophe. We have had
more than the ‘twice ten tedious years’ together, have we not,
Loveday?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” she said, with her sweet, expressive smile, “we are
just beginning the twenty-seventh, Robin, and have had many
holidays, unlike Mr. and Mrs. Gilpin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They were still like lovers, this husband and wife of twenty-six
years’ standing; and it was with a sort of consciousness
that they would be happier if left to themselves, that Frithiof,
who sat between Mrs. Boniface and Cecil, turned toward the
latter, and began to talk to her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Cecil was looking her very best that day. The sun lighted
up her fair hair, the fresh wind brought a glow of healthy color
to her cheeks, her honest gray eyes had lost the grave look
which they usually wore, and were bright and happy-looking;
for she was not at all the sort of girl, who, because she could
not get her own wish, refused to enjoy life. She took all that
came to her brightly enough, and, with a presentiment that
such a treat as this drive with Frithiof would not often fall to
her lot, she gave herself up to present happiness, and put far
from her all anxieties and fears for the future. From the back
seat, peals of laughter from Lance, and Gwen, and Swanhild
reached them. In front, by the side of the driver, they could
see Roy and Sigrid absorbed in their own talk; and with such
surroundings it would have been hard indeed if these two, the
Norwegian, with his sad story, and Cecil, with her life overshadowed
by his trouble, had not been able for a time to throw
off everything that weighed them down, and enjoy themselves
like the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is a thousand times better than a cariole or a stolkjaerre,”
said Frithiof. “What a splendid pace we are going
at, and how well you see the country! It is the perfection of
traveling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I think,” said Cecil. “At any rate, on such a day as
this. In rain, or snow, or burning heat, it might be rather
trying. And then, of course, in the old days we should not
have had it all snugly to ourselves like this; which makes such
a difference.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought over those last words for a minute, and reflected
how among “ourselves” Cecil included the little children of a
criminal, and the foreigners who had scarcely been known to
them for two years. Her warm, generous heart had for him a
very genuine attraction. Possibly, if it had not been for that
chance meeting with Blanche, which had caused an old wound
to break out anew, some thought of love might have stirred in
his breast. As it was, he was merely grateful to her for chasing
away the gloom that for the last few days had hung about him
like a fog. She was to him a cheering ray of sunshine; a
healthy breeze that dispersed the mist; a friend—but nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>On they drove, free of houses at last, or passing only isolated
farms, little villages, and sleepy country towns. The trees
were in all the exquisite beauty of early June, and the Norwegians,
accustomed to less varied foliage, were enthusiastic in
their admiration. They had never known before what it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>to drive along a road bordered by picturesque hedges, with
stately elms here and there, and with oaks and beeches, sycamores
and birches, poplars and chestnuts scattered in such
lavish profusion throughout the landscape.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If we can beat you in mountains, you can certainly
beat us in trees!” cried Sigrid, her blue eyes bright with
happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was enjoying it all as only those who have been toiling
in a great town can enjoy the sights and sounds of the country.
The most humdrum things had an attraction for her, and when
they stopped by and by for tea, at a little roadside inn, she
almost wished their drive at an end, such a longing came over
her to run out into the fields and just gather flowers to her
heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last, after a great deal of tea and bread and butter had
been consumed, they mounted the coach again, leaving a sort
of reflection of their happiness in the hearts of the people of
the inn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s merry-makers and merry-makers,” remarked the
landlord, glancing after them; “yon’s the right sort, and no
mistake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And now Mr. Boniface began to enjoy to the full his surprise.
How he laughed when they implored him to say where
they were going! How triumphant he was when the driver,
who was as deaf as a post, utterly declined to answer leading
questions put to him by Roy!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe we are going to Helmstone, or some great watering-place,
where we shall have to be proper and wear gloves,”
said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was received with groans.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But to get a sight of the sea one would put up with glove-wearing,”
said Sigrid. “And we could, at any rate, walk out
into the country, I suppose, for flowers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Boniface only smiled, however, and looked inscrutable.
And finding that they could not guess their destination in the
least, they took to singing rounds, which made the time pass
by very quickly. At length Frithiof started to his feet with an
eager exclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The sea!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>And sure enough, there, in the distance, was the first glimpse
of a long blue line, which made the hearts of the Norwegians
throb with eager delight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems like being at home again,” said Swanhild, while
Frithiof seemed to drink in new life as the fresh salt wind blew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>once more upon him, bringing back to his mind the memory of
many a perilous adventure in his free, careless boyhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A big watering-place,” groaned Roy. “I told you so.
Houses, churches, a parade, and a pier; I can see them all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where? where?” cried every one, while Mr. Boniface
laughed quietly and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Over there, to the left,” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You prophet of evil!” cried Cecil merrily; “we are turning
quite away to the right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And on they went between the green downs, till they came
to a tiny village, far removed from railways, and leaving even
that behind them, paused at length before a solitary farm-house,
standing a little back from the road, with downs on
either side of it, and barely a quarter of a mile from the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you hear of this delightful place, father?” cried
Cecil; “it is just perfect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I saw it when you and Roy were in Norway two summers
ago,” said Mr. Boniface. “Mother and I drove out here
from Southborne, and took such a fancy to this farm that, like
Captain Cuttle, we made a note of it, and kept it for a surprise
party.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Horner, in his suburban villa, was at that very moment
lamenting his cousin’s absurd extravagance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was always wanting in common-sense, poor fellow,”
observed Mrs. Horner. “But to hire a coach-and-four just to
take into the country his own family and that criminal’s children,
and those precious Norwegians, who apparently think
themselves on a level with the highest in the land—that beats
everything! I suppose he’ll be wanting to hire a palace for
them next bank holiday!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As a matter of fact, the farm-house accommodation was
rather limited, but no one cared about that. Though the
rooms were small, they had a most delicious smell of the country
about them, and every one, moreover, was in a humor to be
as much out of doors as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time seemed to all of them a little like that summer holiday
at Balholm in its freedom and brightness and good-fellowship.
The delightful rambles over the breezy downs, the visit
to the lighthouse, the friendly chats with the coast-guardsmen,
the boating excursions, and the quiet country Sunday—all remained
in their memories for long after.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Roy those days were idyllic; and Sigrid, too, began to
understand for the first time that he was something more to her
than Frithiof’s friend. The two were much together, and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the Monday afternoon, when the rest of the party had gone off
again to the lighthouse for Lance’s special benefit, they wandered
away along the shore, nominally searching among the
rocks for anemones, but far too much absorbed in each other
to prove good collectors.</p>

<p class='c000'>It took a long time really to know Roy, for he was silent and
reserved; but by this time Sigrid had begun to realize how
much there was in him that was well worth knowing, and her
bright, easy manner had always been able to thaw his taciturn
moods. He had, she perceived, his father’s large-mindedness;
he studied the various problems of the day in the same spirit; to
money he was comparatively indifferent; and he was wholly
without that spirit of calculation, that sordid ambition which is
very unjustly supposed to animate most of those engaged in retail
trade. Sigrid had liked him ever since their first meeting
in Norway, but only within the last two days had any thought
of love occurred to her. Even now that thought was scarcely
formed; she was only conscious of being unusually happy, and
of feeling a sort of additional happiness, and a funny sense of
relief when the rest of the party climbed the hill to the lighthouse,
leaving her alone with Roy. Of what they talked she
scarcely knew, but as they wandered on over low rocks and
pools and shingle, hand in hand, because the way was slippery
and treacherous, it seemed to her that she was walking in some
new paradise. The fresh air and beauty after the smoke and the
wilderness of streets; the sense of protection, after the anxieties
of being manager-in-chief to a very poor household;
above all, the joyous brightness after a sad past, made her heart
dance within her; and in her happiness she looked so lovely
that all thought of obstacles and difficulties left Roy’s mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>They sat down to rest in a little sheltered nook under the
high chalk cliffs, and it was there that he poured out to her the
confession of his love, being so completely carried away that for
once words came readily to his lips, so that Sigrid was almost
frightened by his eagerness. How different was this from
Torvald Lundgren’s proposal! How utterly changed was her
whole life since that wintry day when she had walked back
from the Bergen cemetery!</p>

<p class='c000'>What was it that had made everything so bright to her since
then? Was it not the goodness of the man beside her—the
man who had saved her brother’s life—who had brought them
together once more—who now loved her and asked for her
love?</p>

<p class='c000'>When at last he paused, waiting for her reply, she was for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>minute or two quite silent; still her face reassured Roy, and
he was not without hope, so that the waiting-time was not intolerable
to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it were only myself to be thought about,” she said at
length, “I might perhaps give you an answer more readily.
But, you see, there are other people to be considered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The admission she had made sent a throb of delight to
Roy’s heart. Once sure of her love he dreaded no obstacles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are thinking of Frithiof,” he said. “And of course I
would never ask you to leave him; but there would be no
need. If you could love me—if you will be my wife—you
would be much freer than you now are to help him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought of his wealth suddenly flashed into Sigrid’s
mind, giving her a momentary pang; yet, since she really loved
him, it was impossible that this should be a lasting barrier between
them. She looked out over the sea, and the thought of her old
home, and of the debts, and the slow struggle to pay them,
came to her; yet all the time she knew that these could not
separate her from Roy. She loved him, and the world’s praise
or blame were just nothing to her. She could not care in the
least about the way in which such a marriage would be regarded
by outsiders. She loved him; and when once sure that her
marriage would be right—that it would not be selfish, or in
any way bad in its effects on either Frithiof or Swanhild—it
was impossible that she should hesitate any longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of this she was not yet quite sure. All had come upon
her so suddenly that she felt as if she must have time to think
it out quietly before making a definite promise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give me a fortnight,” she said, “and then I will let you
have my answer. It would not be fair to either of us if I
spoke hastily when so much is at stake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy could not complain of this suggestion: it was much that
he was able at last to plead his own cause with Sigrid, and
in her frank blue eyes there lurked something which told him
that he need fear no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile time sped on, and, unheeded by these two, the
tide was coming in. They were so absorbed in their own affairs
that it was not until a wave swept right into the little bay, leaving
a foam-wreath almost at their feet, that they realized their
danger. With a quick exclamation Roy started up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have I been thinking of?” he cried in dismay. “Why,
we are cut off!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid sprang forward and glanced toward Britling Gap. It
was too true. Return was absolutely impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“We could never swim such a distance,” she said. And
turning, she glanced toward the steep white cliff above.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that too is utterly impossible,” said Roy. “Our only
hope is in some pleasure-boat passing. Stay, I have an
idea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hastily opening his knife he began to scoop out footholds in
the chalk. He saw that their sole chance lay in making a
standing-place out of reach of the water, and he worked with
all his might, first securing a place for the feet, then, higher
up, scooping holes for the hands to cling to; he spoke little,
his mind was too full of a torturing sense of blame, a bitter indignation
with himself for allowing his very love to blind him
to such a danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Sigrid, she picked up a pointed stone and began to
work too with desperate energy. She was naturally brave, and
as long as she could do anything her heart scarcely beat faster
than usual. It was the waiting-time that tried her, the clinging
to that uncompromising white cliff, while below the waves
surged to and fro with the noise that only that morning she
had thought musical, but which now seemed to her almost intolerable.
If it had not been that Roy’s arm was round her,
holding her closely, she could never have borne up so long; she
would have turned giddy and fallen back into the water. But
his strength seemed to her equal to anything, and her perfect
confidence in him filled her with a wonderful energy of endurance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their terrible position all sense of time left them; they
could not tell whether it was for minutes or for hours that
they had clung to their frail refuge, when at length a shout from
above reached their ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Courage!” cried a voice. “A boat is coming to your
help. Hold on!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hope renewed their strength in a wonderful way; they were
indeed less to be pitied than those who had the fearful anxiety
of rescuing them, or watching the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Frithiof who had first discovered them; the rest of the
party, after seeing over the lighthouse, had wandered along the
cliffs talking to an old sailor, and, Lance being seized with a
desire to see over the edge, Frithiof had set Cecil’s mind at
rest by lying down with the little fellow and holding him securely
while he glanced down the sheer descent to the sea. A little
farther on, to the left, he suddenly perceived, to his horror,
the two clinging figures, and at once recognized them. Dragging
the child back, he sprang up and seized the old sailor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>arm, interrupting a long-winded story to which Mr. Boniface
was listening.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are two people down there, cut off by the tide,” he
said. “What is the quickest way to reach them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Lord!” cried the old man; “why, there’ll be nought
quicker than a boat at Britling Gap, or ropes brought from
there and let down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell them help is coming,” said Frithiof “I will row
round.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And without another word he set off running like the wind
toward the coast-guard station. On and on he rushed over
the green downs, past the little white chalk-heaps that marked
the coast-guard’s nightly walk, past the lighthouse and down
the hill to the little sheltered cove. Though a good runner, he
was sadly out of training; his breath came now in gasps, his
throat felt as though it were on fire, and all the time a terrible
dread filled his heart. Supposing he were too late!</p>

<p class='c000'>At Britling Gap not a soul was in sight, and he dared not
waste time in seeking help. The boat was in its usual place on
the beach. He shoved it out to sea, sprang into it, paused
only to fling off his coat, then with desperate energy pulled
toward the place where Roy and Sigrid awaited their rescuer
with fast-failing strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet in all Frithiof’s anxiety there came to him a strange
sense of satisfaction, an excitement which banished from his
mind all the specters of the past, a consciousness of power that
in itself was invigorating. Danger seemed to be his native
element, daring his strongest characteristic, and while straining
every nerve and making the little boat bound through the
water, he was more at rest than he had been for months, just
because everything personal had faded into entire insignificance
before the absorbing need of those whom he loved.</p>

<p class='c000'>How his pulses throbbed when at length he caught sight of
Sigrid’s figure! and with what skill he guided his boat toward the
cliff, shouting out encouragement and warning! The two were
both so stiff and exhausted that it was no easy task to get them
down into the boat, but he managed it somehow, and a glad
cheer from above showed that the watchers were following
their every movement with eager sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us walk back quickly,” said Mr. Boniface, “that we
may be ready to meet them,” and with an intensity of relief
they hurried back to Britling Gap, arriving just in time to greet
the three as they walked up the beach. Sigrid, though rather
pale and exhausted, seemed little the worse for the adventure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and a glad color flooded her cheeks when Mr. Boniface turned
to Frithiof and grasping his hand, thanked him warmly for
what he had done. Cecil said scarcely anything; she could
hardly trust herself to speak, but her heart beat fast as, glancing
at Frithiof, she saw on his face the bright look which made
him once more like the Frithiof she had met long ago at
Bergen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Boniface insisted on keeping them all till the following
day, when once more they enjoyed the delights of coaching,
getting back to London in the cool of the evening, laden
with wild roses, hawthorn, and field flowers, which gladdened
more than one of their neighbors’ rooms in the model
lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not till Wednesday in Whitsun-week that Frithiof
found himself in his old place behind the counter, and it took
several days before they all got into working order again, for
though the holiday had done them good, yet it was not very
easy to get back into the routine of business. But by Monday
everything was in clockwork order again, and even Mr. Horner,
though ready enough at all times to grumble, could find
nothing to make a fuss about. It happened that day that Mr.
Horner was more in the shop than usual, for Roy had unexpectedly
been obliged to go to Paris on business, and it chanced,
much to his satisfaction, that, while Mr. Boniface was dining,
Sardoni the tenor called to speak about a song. There was
nothing that he enjoyed so much as interviewing any well-known
singer; he seemed to gain a sort of reflected glory in
the process, and Frithiof could hardly help smiling when at
the close of the interview they passed through the shop, so
comical was the obsequious manner of the little man toward
the tall, jolly-looking singer, and so curious the contrast between
the excessive politeness of his tone to the visitor, and
his curt command, “Open the door, Falck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof opened the door promptly, but the tenor, whose
mischievous eyes evidently took in everything that savored of
fun, saw plainly enough that the Norseman, with his dignity
of manner and nobility of bearing, deemed Mr. Horner as a
man beneath contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, by the way, Mr. Horner,” he exclaimed suddenly,
turning back just as he had left the shop; “I quite forgot to
ask if you could oblige me with change for a five-pound note.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>I have tried to get it twice this morning, but change seems to
be short.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With the greatest pleasure,” said Mr. Horner deferentially.</p>

<p class='c000'>And pushing past Frithiof, he himself deposited the note in
the till and counted out five sovereigns, which he handed with
a bow to Sardoni.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with a friendly “good-day,” the singer went out, and
Mr. Horner, rubbing his hands with an air of great satisfaction,
retired to Mr. Boniface’s room. The afternoon passed on just
as hundreds of afternoons had passed before it, with the usual
succession of customers, the usual round of monotonous work;
there was nothing to mark it in any way, and no sense of coming
evil made itself felt. In the most prosaic manner possible,
Frithiof went out for the few minutes’ stroll in the streets which
he called tea-time. He was in good spirits, and as he walked
along he thought of the days by the sea, and of the boating
which he had so much enjoyed, living it all over again in this
hot, dusty London, where June was far from delightful. Still,
it was something to be out in the open air, to get a few
moments of leisure and to stretch one’s legs. He walked along
pretty briskly, managing to get some little enjoyment out of
his short respite, and this was well; for it was long before he
could enjoy anything again in that unconcerned, free-hearted
way. Yet nothing warned him of this; quite carelessly he
pushed open the double swing-doors and re-entered the shop,
glancing with surprise but with no special concern at the little
group behind the counter. Mr. Horner was finding fault
about something, but that was a very ordinary occurrence. A
thin, grave-looking man stood listening attentively, and Mr.
Boniface listened too with an expression of great trouble on
his face. Looking up, he perceived Frithiof, and with an exclamation
of relief came toward him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is Mr. Falck!” he said; “who no doubt will be
able to explain everything satisfactorily. A five-pound note
has somehow disappeared from your till this afternoon, Frithiof;
do you know anything about it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was certainly in the till when I last opened it,” said
Frithiof; “and that was only a few minutes before I went
out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very possibly,” said Mr. Horner. “The question is
whether it was there when you shut it again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tone even more than the words made Frithiof’s blood
boil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir,” he said furiously, “do you dare to insinuate that I—”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>But Mr. Boniface laid a hand on his arm and interrupted
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof,” he said, “you know quite well that I should as
soon suspect my own son as you. But this note has disappeared
in a very extraordinary way, while only you and Darnell
were in the shop, and we must do our best to trace it out. I
am sure you will help me in this disagreeable business by going
through the ordinary form quietly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, turning to the private detective who had been hastily
called in by Mr. Horner, he suggested that they should come
to his own room. Mr. Horner shut the door with an air of
satisfaction. From the first he had detested the Norwegian,
and now was delighted to feel that his dislike was justified.
Mr. Boniface, looking utterly miserable, sat down in his arm-chair
to await the result of the inquiry, and the two men who
lay under suspicion stood before the detective, who with his
practiced eye glanced now at one, now at the other, willing if
possible to spare the innocent man the indignity of being
searched.</p>

<p class='c000'>Darnell was a rather handsome fellow, with a short dark
beard and heavy moustache: he looked a trifle paler than
usual, but was quite quiet and collected, perhaps a little upset
at the unusual disturbance in the shop where for so long he
had worked, yet without the faintest sign of personal uneasiness
about him. Beside him stood the tall Norwegian, his fair
skin showing all too plainly the burning color that had rushed
to his face the instant he knew that he lay actually under suspicion
of thieving. Mr. Horner’s words still made him tingle
from head to foot, and he could gladly have taken the man by
the throat and shaken the breath out of him. For the suspicion,
hard enough for any man to bear, was doubly hard to him on
account of his nationality. That a Norwegian should be otherwise
than strictly honorable was to Frithiof a monstrous idea.
He knew well that he and his countrymen in general had
plenty of faults, but scrupulous honesty was so ingrained in
his Norse nature, that to have the slightest doubt cast upon
his honor was to him an intolerable insult. The detective
could not, of course, understand this. He was a clever and a
conscientious man, but his experience was, after all, limited.
He had not traveled in Norway, or studied the character of
its people; he did not know that you may leave all your luggage
outside an inn in the public highway without the least
fear that in the night any one will meddle with it: he did not
know that if you give a Norse child a coin equal to sixpence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>in return for a great bowl of milk, it will refuse with real distress
to keep it, because the milk was worth a little less; he
had not heard the story of the lost chest of plate, which by
good chance was washed up on the Norwegian coast, how the
experts examined the crest on the spoons, and after infinite
labor and pains succeeded in restoring it to its rightful owner
in a far-away southern island. It was, after all, quite natural
that he should suspect the man who had colored so deeply,
who protested so indignantly against the mere suspicion of
guilt, who clearly shrank from the idea of being searched.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will examine you first,” said the detective; and Frithiof,
seeing that there was no help for it, submitted with haughty
composure to the indignity. For an instant even Mr. Horner
was shaken in his opinion, there was such an evident consciousness
of innocence in the Norwegian’s whole manner and
bearing now that the ordeal had actually come.</p>

<p class='c000'>In solemn silence two pockets were turned inside out. The
right-hand waistcoat pocket was apparently empty, but the
careful detective turned that inside out too. Suddenly Mr.
Boniface started forward with an ejaculation of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I told you so,” cried Mr. Horner vehemently.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Frithiof, roused to take notice, which before he had
not condescended to do, looked down and saw a sight that
made his heart stand still.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carefully pinned to the inside of the pocket was a clean,
fresh, five-pound note. He did not speak a word, but just
stared at the thing in blank amazement. There was a painful
silence. Surely it could be nothing but a bad dream!</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at the unconcerned detective, and at Mr. Horner’s
excited face, and at Mr. Boniface’s expression of grief
and perplexity. It was no dream; it was a most horrible
reality—a reality which he was utterly incapable of explaining.
With an instinct that there was yet one man present who
trusted him, in spite of appearances, he made a step or two
toward Mr. Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir,” he said, in great agitation, “I swear to you that I knew
nothing of this. It has astounded me as much as it has surprised
you. How it came there I can’t say, but certainly I
didn’t put it there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Boniface was silent, and glancing back Frithiof saw on
the thin lips of the detective a very expressive smile. The
sight almost maddened him. In the shock of the discovery he
had turned very pale, now the violence of his wrath made him
flush to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“If you didn’t put it there, who did?” said Mr. Horner indignantly.
“Don’t add to your sin, young man, by falsehood.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have never spoken a falsehood in my life; it is you who
lie when you say that I put the note there,” said Frithiof
hotly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My poor fellow,” said Mr. Boniface, “I am heartily sorry
for you, but you must own that appearances are against you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! you too, sir!” cried Frithiof, his indignation giving
place to heartbroken wonder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tone went to Mr. Boniface’s heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think you did it quite unconsciously,” he said. “I am
sure you never could have taken it had you known what you
were about. You did it in absence of mind—in a fit of temporary
aberration. It is, perhaps, a mere result of your illness
last summer, and no one would hold you responsible for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A horrible wave of doubt passed over Frithiof. Could this
indeed be the explanation? But it was only for a moment.
He could not really believe it; he knew that there was no truth
in this suggestion of brain disturbance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No one in absence of mind could deliberately have pinned
the note in,” he said. “Besides my head was perfectly clear,
not even aching or tired.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite so; I am glad that so far you own the truth,” said
Mr. Horner. “Make a free confession at once and we will not
press the prosecution. You yielded to a sudden temptation,
and, as we all know, have special reasons for needing money.
Come, confess!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are not bound to incriminate yourself,” said the detective,
who, as acting in a private capacity, was not bound to
urge the prosecution. “Still, what the gentleman suggests is
by far the best course for you to take. There’s not a jury in
the land that would not give a verdict against you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall certainly not tell a lie to save open disgrace,” said
Frithiof. “The jury may say what it likes. God knows I
am innocent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tone in which he said the last words made Mr. Boniface
look at him more closely. Strangely enough it was in that moment
of supreme bitterness, when he fully realized the hopelessness
of his position, when one of his employers deemed him a
madman and the other a thief, then, when disgrace and ruin and
utter misery stared him in the face, that the faint glimpses of the
Unseen, which, from time to time, had dawned for him, broadened
into full sunlight. For the first time in his life he stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>in close personal relationship with the Power in whom he had
always vaguely believed, the higher Presence became to him
much more real than men surrounding him with their pity and
indignation and contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Mr. Horner was not the sort of man to read faces, much
less to read hearts; the very emphasis with which Frithiof had
spoken made him more angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now I <em>know</em> that you are lying!” he cried: “don’t add
blasphemy to your crime. You are the most irreligious fellow I
ever came across—a man who, to my certain knowledge, never
attends any place of public worship, and do you dare to call
God to witness for you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing but the strong consciousness of this new Presence
kept Frithiof from making a sharp retort. But a great calmness
had come over him, and his tone might have convinced even
Mr. Horner had he not been so full of prejudice. “God
knows I am innocent,” he repeated; “and only He can tell
how the note got here; I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One word with you, if you please, Mr. Harris,” said Robert
Boniface, suddenly pushing back his chair and rising to his
feet, as though he could no longer tolerate the discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He led the way back to the shop, where, in low tones, he
briefly gave the detective his own opinion of the case. He
was sure that Frithiof firmly believed he was telling the truth,
but, unable to doubt the evidence of his own senses, he was
obliged to take up the plausible theory of temporary aberration.
The detective shrugged his shoulders a little, and said
it might possibly be so, but the young man seemed to him remarkably
clear-headed. However, he accepted his fee and
went off, and Mr. Boniface returned sadly enough to his room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can go back to the shop, Darnell,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man bowed and withdrew, leaving Frithiof still standing
half-bewildered where the detective had left him, the cause
of all his misery lying on the writing-table before him, just as
fresh and crisp-looking as when it had issued from the Bank
of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This has been a sad business, Frithiof,” said Mr. Boniface,
leaning his elbow on the mantel-piece, and looking with
his clear, kindly eyes at the young Norwegian. “But I am
convinced that you had no idea what you were doing, and I
should not dream of prosecuting you, or discharging you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Frithiof was far too much stunned to be able to feel any
gratitude for this. Mr. Horner, however, left him no time to
reply.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“I think you have taken leave of your senses, Boniface,” he
said vehemently. “Save yourself the annoyance of prosecuting,
if you like; but it is grossly unfair to the rest of your employees
to keep a thief in your house. Not only that, but it is
altogether immoral; it is showing special favor to vice; it is
admitting a principle which, if allowed, would ruin all business
life. If there is one thing noticeable in all successful
concerns it is that uncompromising severity is shown to even
trifling errors—even to carelessness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My business has hitherto been successful,” said Mr. Boniface
quietly, “and I have never gone on that principle, and
never will. Why are we to have a law of mercy and rigidly to
exclude it from every-day life? But that is the way of the
world. It manages, while calling itself Christian, to shirk most
of Christ’s commands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tell you,” said Mr. Horner, who was now in a towering
passion, “that it is utterly against the very rules of religion.
The fellow is not repentant; he persists in sticking to a lie,
and yet you weakly forgive him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If,” said Mr. Boniface quietly, “you knew a little more of
Frithiof Falck you would know that it is quite impossible that
he could consciously have taken the money. When he took it
he was not himself. If he had wanted to hide it—to steal it—why
did he actually return to the shop with it in his possession?
He might easily have disposed of it while he was out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If that is your ground, then I object to having a man on
my premises who is afflicted with kleptomania. But it is not
so. The fellow is as long-headed and quick-witted as any one
I know; he has managed to hoodwink you, but from the first
I saw through him, and knew him to be a designing—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir,” broke in Frithiof, turning to Mr. Boniface—his bewildered
consternation changing now to passionate earnestness—“this
is more than I can endure. For God’s sake call back the
detective, examine further into this mystery; there <em>must</em> be
some explanation!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can any man examine further?” said Mr. Boniface
sadly. “The note is missed, and is actually found upon you.
The only possible explanation is that you were not yourself
when you took it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the least you can do is to dismiss him,” resumed
Mr. Horner. But Mr. Boniface interrupted him very
sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will please remember, James, that you are in no way
concerned with the engagement or dismissal of those employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>in this house. That is entirely my affair, as is set forth in our
deed of partnership.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which partnership will need renewing in another six
months,” said Mr. Horner, growing red with anger. “And I
give you fair warning that, if this dishonest fellow is kept on, I
shall then withdraw my capital and retire from the business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this Parthian shot he went out, banging the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof had borne in silence all the taunts and insults showered
on him; but when he found himself alone with the man
to whom he owed so much, he very nearly broke down altogether.
“Sir,” he said, trying in vain to govern his voice,
“you have been very good to me; but it will be best that I
should go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would not have you leave for the world,” said Mr. Boniface.
“Remember that your sisters are dependent on you.
You must think first of them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Frithiof firmly; “I must first think of what I
owe to you. It would be intolerable to me to feel that I had
brought any loss on you through Mr. Horner’s anger. I must
go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nonsense,” said Mr. Boniface. “I cannot hear of such a
thing. Why, how do you think you would get another situation
with this mystery still hanging over you? I, who know
you so well, am convinced of your perfect freedom from blame.
But strangers could not possibly be convinced of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof was silent; he thought of Sigrid and Swanhild suffering
through his trouble, he remembered his terrible search for
work when he first came to London, and he realized that it was
chiefly his own pride that prompted him never to return to the
shop. After all, what a prospect it was! With one partner
deeming him a thief and the other forced to say that he must
be subject to a form of insanity; with the men employed in the
shop all ready to deem him a dishonest foreigner! How was he
to bear such a terrible position? Yet bear it he must; nay,
he must be thankful for the chance of being allowed to bear it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you are indeed willing that I should stay,” he said, at
length, “then I will stay. But your theory—the theory that
makes you willing still to trust me—is mistaken. I know that
there is not a minute in this day when my head has not been
perfectly clear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear fellow, you must allow me to keep what theory I
please. There is no other explanation than this, and you
would be wisest if you accepted it yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“That is impossible,” said Frithiof sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is equally impossible that I can doubt the evidence of
my own senses. The note was there, and you can’t possibly
explain its presence. How is it possible that Darnell could
have crossed over to your till, taken out the note and pinned it
in your pocket? Besides, what motive could he have for doing
such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” said Frithiof; “yet I shall swear to my
dying day that I never did it myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, there is no use in arguing the point,” said Robert
Boniface wearily. “It is enough for me that I can account to
myself for what must otherwise be an extraordinary mystery.
You had better go back to your work now, and do not worry
over the affair. Remember that I do not hold you responsible
for what has happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After this of course nothing more could be said. Frithiof
left the room feeling years older than when he had entered it,
and with a heavy heart took that first miserable plunge into
the outer world—the world where he must now expect to meet
with suspicious looks and cold dislike.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As he walked down the sort of avenue of pianos and harmoniums
in the inner shop, there came to his mind, why, he could
not have told, words spoken to him long before by that customer
who had left on his mind so lasting an impression, “Courage!
the worst will pass.” Though he could not exactly believe
the words, yet he clung to them with a sort of desperation.
Also he happened to notice the clock, and practically
adopted Sydney Smith’s wise maxim, “Take short views.”
There were exactly two hours and a quarter before closing time;
he could at any rate endure as long as that, and of the future
he would not think. There were no customers in the shop,
but he could hear voices in eager discussion, and he knew quite
well what was the subject of their talk. Of course the instant
he came into sight a dead silence ensued, and the little group,
consisting of Foster, Darnell, one of the tuners, and the boy
who made himself generally useful, dispersed at once, while in
the ominous quiet Frithiof went to his usual place. The first
few minutes were terrible; he sat down at his desk, took up
his pen, and opened the order-book, making a feint of being
actually employed, but conscious only of the dreadful silence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>and of the eyes that glanced curiously at him; again a burning
flush passed over his face, just from the horror and shame of
even being suspected of dishonesty. It was a relief to him
when a customer entered, a man entirely ignorant of all that
had passed, and only bent on securing the best seats to be had
for Mr. Boniface’s concert on the following day. Carlo Donati,
the celebrated baritone, was to sing, and as he had only appeared
once before that season, except in opera, there was a
great demand for tickets, which kept them pretty busy until at
length the longed-for closing came; the other men lingered a
little to discuss afresh the great event of the day, but Frithiof,
who had been watching the hands of the clock with longing
eyes, felt as if he could not have borne the atmosphere of the
shop for another minute, and snatching up his hat made for
the door. None of them said good-night to him; they were
not intentionally unkind, but they were awkward, and they felt
that the strange affair of the afternoon had made a great gulf
between them and the culprit. However, Frithiof was past
caring much for trifles, for after the first moment of intense
relief, as he felt the cool evening air blowing on him, the sense
of another trouble to be met had overpowered all else. He
had got somehow to tell Sigrid of his disgrace, to bring the
cloud which shadowed him into the peaceful home that had
become so dear to him. Very slowly he walked through the
noisy streets, very reluctantly crossed the great courtyard, and
mounted flight after flight of stairs. At the threshold he hesitated,
wondering whether it would be possible to shield them
from the knowledge. He could hear Sigrid singing in the
kitchen as she prepared the supper, and something told him
that it would be impossible to conceal his trouble from her.
With a sigh he opened the door into the sitting-room; it looked
very bright and cheerful; Swanhild stood at the open window
watering the flowers in the window-box, red and white geraniums
and southernwood, grown from cuttings given by Cecil.
She gave him her usual merry greeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come and look at my garden, Frithiof,” she said. “Doesn’t
it look lovely?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, you are late,” said Sigrid, coming in with the cocoa,
her face a little flushed with the fire, which was trying on that
summer-day. Then, glancing at him, “How tired you look!
Come, sit down and eat. I have got a German sausage that
even Herr Sivertsen would not grumble at. The heat has tired
you, and you will feel better after you have had something.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He ate obediently, though the food almost choked him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Swanhild, fancying that he had one of his bad headaches, grew
quiet, and afterwards was not surprised to find that he did
not as usual get out his writing materials, but asked Sigrid to go
out with him for a turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are too tired to try the translating?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I’ll try it later,” he said; “but let us have half an
hour’s walk together now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She consented at once and went to put on her hat, well knowing
that Frithiof never shirked his work without good reason;
then leaving strict orders with Swanhild not to sit up after nine,
they left her absorbed in English history, and went down into
the cool, clear twilight. Some children were playing quietly
in the courtyard; Sigrid stopped for a minute to speak to one
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is your father better this evening?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, miss, and he’s a-goin’ back to work to-morrow,” replied
the child, lifting a beaming face up to the friendly Norwegian
lady, who had become a general favorite among her neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is one of the little Hallifields,” explained Sigrid, as
they passed on. “The father, you know, is a tram-car conductor,
and the work is just killing him by inches; some day
you really must have a talk with him and just hear what terrible
hours he has to keep. It makes me sick to think of it. How
I wish you were in Parliament, Frithiof, and could do something
to put down all the grievances that we are forever coming
across!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There was once a time when at home we used to dream
that I might even be a king’s minister,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in his voice made her sorry for her last speech;
she knew that one of his fits of depression had seized him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So we did, and perhaps after all you may be. It was always,
you know, through something very disagreeable that in
the old stories the highest wish was attained. Remember the
‘Wild Swans.’ And even ‘Cinderella’ has that thought running
through it. We are taught the same thing from our nursery
days upward. And, you know, though there are some
drawbacks, I think living like this, right among the people, is a
splendid training. One can understand their troubles so much
better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should have thought you had troubles enough of your
own,” he said moodily, “without bothering yourself with
other people’s.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But since our own troubles I have somehow cared more
about them; I don’t feel afraid as I used to do of sick people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and people who have lost those belonging to them. I want
always to get nearer to them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” he said desperately, “can you bear a fresh trouble
for yourself? I have bad news for you to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her heart seemed to stop beating.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Roy?” she asked breathlessly, her mind instinctively turning
first to fears for his safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any other time Frithiof would have guessed the truth
through that tremulous, unguarded question, which had escaped
her involuntarily. But he was too miserable to notice it then.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no, Roy is still at Paris. They heard to-day that he
could not be back in time for the concert. It is I who have
brought this trouble on you. Though how it came about God
only knows. Listen, and I’ll tell you exactly how everything
happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time they had reached one of the parks, and they sat
down on a bench under the shade of a great elm-tree. Frithiof
could not bear to look at Sigrid, could not endure to watch the
effect of his words; he fixed his eyes on the smutty sheep that
were feeding on the grass opposite him. Then very quietly
and minutely he told exactly what had passed that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad,” she exclaimed when he paused, “that Mr.
Boniface was so kind. And yet, how can he think that of
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You do not think it, then?” he asked, looking her full in
the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! think that you took it in absence of mind? Think
that it would be possible for you deliberately to take it out of
the till and pin it in your own pocket! Why, of course not!
In actual delirium, I suppose, a man might do anything, but
you are as strong and well as any one else. Of course, you
had nothing whatever to do with it, either consciously or unconsciously.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet the thing was somehow there, and the logical inference
is, that I must have put it there,” he said, scanning her
face with keen attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t care a fig for logical inference,” she cried, with a
little vehement motion of her foot. “All I know is that you
had nothing whatever to do with it. If I had to die for maintaining
that, I would say it with my last breath.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He caught her hand in his and held it fast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you still believe in me, the worst is over,” he said.
“With the rest of the world, of course, my character is gone,
but there is no help for that.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“But there must be help,” said Sigrid. “Some one else
must be guilty. The other man in the shop must certainly have
put it there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For what purpose?” said Frithiof sadly. “Besides, how
could he have done it without my knowledge?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” said Sigrid, beginning to perceive the difficulties
of the case. “What sort of a man is he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I used to dislike him at first, and he naturally disliked me
because I was a foreigner. But latterly we have got on well
enough. He is a very decent sort of fellow, and I don’t for a
moment believe that he would steal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of you must have done it,” said Sigrid. “And as I
certainly never could believe that you did it, I am forced to
think the other man guilty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof was silent. If he did not agree with her, was he not
bound to accept Mr. Boniface’s theory? The horrible mystery
of the affair was almost more than he could endure; his past
had been miserable enough, but he had never known anything
equal to the misery of being innocent yet absolutely unable to
prove this innocence. Sigrid, glancing at him anxiously, could
see even in the dim twilight what a heavy look of trouble
clouded his face, and resolutely turning from the puzzling question
of how the mystery could be explained, she set herself to
make as light of the whole affair as was possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look, Frithiof,” she said; “why should we waste time and
strength in worrying over this? After all, what difference does
it make to us in ourselves? Business hours must, of course, be
disagreeable enough to you, but at home you must forget the
disagreeables; at home you are my hero, unjustly accused and
bearing the penalty of another’s crime.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled a little, touched by her eagerness of tone, and
cheered, in spite of himself, by her perfect faith in him. Yet
all through the night he tossed to and fro in sleepless misery,
trying to find some possible explanation of the afternoon’s
mystery, racking his brain to think of all that he had done or
said since that unlucky hour when Sardoni had asked for
change.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, as a natural consequence, he began the day
with a dull, miserable headache; at breakfast he hardly spoke,
and he set off for business looking so ill that Sigrid wondered
whether he could possibly get through his work. It was certainly
strange, she could not help thinking, that fate seemed so
utterly against him, and that when at last his life was beginning
to look brighter, he should again be the victim of another’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>fault. And then, with a sort of comfort, there flashed into
her mind an idea which almost reconciled her to his lot.
What if these obstacles so hard to be surmounted, these
difficulties that hemmed him in so persistently, were after
all only the equivalent to the physical dangers and difficulties
of the life of the old Vikings? Did it not, in truth, need
greater courage and endurance for the nineteenth-century Frithiof
to curb all his natural desires and instincts and toil at uncongenial
work in order to pay off his father’s debts, than for
the Frithiof of olden times to face all the dangers of the sea, and
of foes spiritual and temporal who beset him when he went to
win back the lost tribute money? It was, after all, a keen
pleasure to the old Frithiof to fight with winds and waves; but
it was a hard struggle to the modern Frithiof to stand behind a
counter day after day. And then again, was it not less bitter
for the Frithiof of the Saga to be suspected of sacrilege, than
for Frithiof Falck to be suspected of the most petty and contemptible
act of dishonesty?</p>

<p class='c000'>She was right. Anything, however painful and difficult,
would have been gladly encountered by poor Frithiof if it
could have spared him that miserable return to his old place in
Mr. Boniface’s shop. And that day’s prosaic work needed
greater moral courage than any previous day of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>About half-past nine there arrived a telegram which did not
mend matters. Mr. Boniface was seriously unwell, would not
be in town that day, and could not be at St. James’s Hall that
evening for the concert. Mr. Horner would take his place.
Frithiof’s heart sank at this news; and when presently the
fussy, bumptious, little man entered the shop the climax of
his misery was reached. Mr. Horner read the telegram with
a disturbed air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear! dear! seriously ill, I’m afraid, or he would at least
make an effort to come to-night. But after all the annoyance
of yesterday I am not surprised—no, not at all. Such a
thing has never happened in his business before, ay, Mr.
Foster?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no, sir,” said the foreman in a low voice, sorry in his
heart for the young Norwegian, who could not avoid hearing
every word.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was quite enough to make him ill. Such a disgraceful
affair in a house of this class. For his own sake he does well
to hush it up, though I intend to see that all proper precautions
are taken; upon that, at any rate, I insist. If I had my own
way there should have been none of this misplaced leniency.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Here, William!” and he beckoned to the boy, who was irreverently
flicking the bust of Mozart with a duster.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” said William, who, being out of the trouble himself,
secretly rather enjoyed the commotion it had caused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go at once to Smith, the ironmonger, and order him to
send some one round to fix a spring bell on a till. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite, sir,” replied William, unable to resist glancing
across the counter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof went on arranging some music that had just arrived,
but he flushed deeply, and Mr. Horner, glad to have
found a vulnerable point of attack, did not scruple to make the
most of his opportunity. Never, surely, did ironmonger do
his work so slowly! Never, surely, did an employer give so
much of his valuable time to directing exactly what was to be
done, and superintending an affair about which he knew nothing.
But the fixing of that detestable bell gave Mr. Horner
a capitol excuse for being in the shop at Frithiof’s elbow, and
every word and look conveyed such insulting suspicion of
the Norwegian that honest old Foster began to feel angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why should I mind this vulgar brute?” thought Frithiof,
as he forced himself to go on with his work with the air of
quiet determination which Mr. Horner detested. But all the
same he did care, and it was the very vulgarity of the attack
that made him inwardly wince. His headache grew worse and
worse, while in maddening monotony came the sounds of
piano tuning from the inner shop, hammering and bell-ringing
at the till close by, and covert insults and innuendoes from
the grating voice of James Horner. How much an employer
can do for those in his shop, how close and cordial the relation
may be, he had learnt from his intercourse with Mr. Boniface.
He now learnt the opposite truth, that no position
affords such constant opportunities for petty tyranny if the
head of the firm happens to be mean or prejudiced. The
miserable hours dragged on somehow, and at last, late in the
afternoon, Foster came up to him with a message.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Horner wishes to speak to you,” he said; “I will
take your place here.” Then, lowering his voice cautiously,
“It’s my opinion, Mr. Falck, that he is trying to goad you
into resigning, or into an impertinent answer which would
be sufficient to cause your dismissal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you for the warning,” said Frithiof gratefully, and
a little encouraged by the mere fact that the foreman cared
enough for him to speak in such a way, he went to the private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>room, determined to be on his guard and not to let pride or
anger get the better of his dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Horner replied to his knock, but did not glance round
as he entered the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You wished to speak to me, sir?” asked Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, when I have finished this letter. You can wait,” said
Mr. Horner ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>He waited quietly, thinking to himself how different was the
manner both of Mr. Boniface and of his son, who were always
as courteous to their employees as to their customers, and would
have thought themselves as little justified in using such a tone
to one of the men as of employing the slave-whip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Horner, flattering himself that he was producing an impression
and emphasizing the difference between their respective
positions, finished his letter, signed his name with a flourish
characteristic of his opinion of himself, then swung round his
chair and glanced at Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Boniface left no instructions as to whether you were to
attend as usual at St. James’s Hall to-night,” he began. “But
since no one else is used to the work I suppose there is no
help for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused, apparently expecting some rejoinder, but Frithiof
merely stood there politely attentive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Since you know the work, and are used to it, you had better
attend as usual, for I should be vexed if any hitch should
occur in the arrangements. But understand, pray, that I
strongly disapprove of your remaining in our employ at all, and
that it is only out of necessity that I submit to it, for I consider
you unfit to mix with respectable people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever the Norwegian felt, he managed to preserve a perfectly
unmoved aspect. Mr. Horner, who wanted to stir him
into indignant expostulation, was sorely disappointed that his
remarks fell so flat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see you intend to brazen it out,” he said crushingly.
“But you don’t deceive me. You may leave the room, and
take good care that all the arrangements to-night are properly
carried out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” said Frithiof, with the quietness of one who
knows that he remains master of the situation. But afterward,
when he was once more in the shop, the insults returned to his
mind with full force, and lay rankling there for many a day to
come. Owing to the concert, his release came a little sooner
than usual, and it was not much after seven when Sigrid heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>him at the door. His face frightened her; it looked so worn
and harassed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will have time for some supper?” she asked pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he said, passing by her quickly, “I am not hungry,
and must change my clothes and be off again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He might fancy some coffee,” said Sigrid to herself.
“Quick, Swanhild, run and get it ready while I boil the water.
There is nothing like strong <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café noir</span></i> when one is tired out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps it did him some good; and the glimpse of his home
certainly cheered him; yet, nevertheless, he was almost ready
that night to give up everything in despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Physical exhaustion had dulled the glow of inner comfort
that had come to him on the previous day. In his miserable
depression all his old doubts assailed him once more. Was
there any rule of justice after all? Was there anything in
heaven above, or in the earth beneath, but cruel lust of power,
and an absolute indifference to suffering? His old hatred
against those who succeeded once more filled his heart, and
though at one time he had felt curious to see Donati, and had
heard all that Cecil had to say in favor of the Italian’s courage
and unselfishness, yet now, in his bitterness of soul, he began
to hate the man merely because of his popularity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I detest these conceited, set-up idols of the public,” he
thought to himself. “When all men speak well of a fellow it is
time to suspect him. His goodness and all the rest of it is probably
all calculation—a sort of advertisement!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The architects of most English music-halls have scant regard
for the comfort of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artistes</span></i>. It often used to strike Frithiof
as a strange thing that in the Albert Hall, singers, whose health
and strength were of priceless value, had to wait about in
draughty, sloping passages, on uncomfortable chairs, while at
St. James’s Hall they had only the option of marching up and
down a cold, stone staircase to the cloak-room between every
song, or of sitting in the dingy little den opening on to the platform
steps—a den which resembles a family pew in a meetinghouse.
Here, sitting face to face on hard benches, were
ranged to-night many of the first singers of the day. There
was Sardoni, the good-natured English tenor and composer.
There was Mme. Sardoni-Borelli, with her noble and striking
face and manner; besides a host of other celebrities, all the
more dear to the audience because for years and years they had
been giving their very best to the nation. But Carlo Donati had
not yet arrived, and Mr. Horner kept glancing anxiously through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the glass doors on to the staircase in hopes of catching sight of
the great baritone. Frithiof lived through it all like a man in a
dream, watched a young English tenor who was to make his
first appearance that night, saw him walking to and fro in a
tremendous state of nervousness, heard the poor fellow sing
badly enough, and watched him plunge down the steps again
amid the very faint applause of the audience. Next came the
turn of Mme. Sardoni-Borelli. Her husband handed her the
song she was to sing, she gave some directions to the accompanist
as to the key in which she wanted it played, and mounted
the platform with a composed dignity that contrasted curiously
with the manner of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutant</span></i> who had preceded her. Mr.
Horner turned to Frithiof at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go and see whether Signor Donati has come,” he said.
“His song is next on the programme.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah,” said Sardoni, with a smile, “he is such a tremendous
fellow for home, he never comes a moment too soon, and at the
theater often runs it even closer than this. He is the quickest
dresser I ever knew, though, and is never behind time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof made his way to the cloak room, and, as he walked
through the narrow room leading to it, he could distinctly hear
the words of some one within. The voice seemed familiar
to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Badly received? Well, you only failed because of nervousness.
In your second song you will be more used to things,
and you will see, it will go much better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But <em>you</em> surely can never have had the same difficulty to
struggle with?” said the young tenor, who, with a very downcast
face, stood talking to the newly arrived baritone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!” exclaimed the other, with a laugh which rang
through the room, “Ask Sardoni! He’ll tell you of my first
appearance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as Frithiof gave his message, the speaker turned round
and revealed to the Norwegian that face which had fascinated
him so strangely just before his illness—a face not only beautiful
in outline and coloring, but full of an undefined charm,
which made all theories as to the conceit and objectionableness
of successful men fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” he said, bowing in reply; “I will come down
at once.” Then, turning again to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutant</span></i> with a smile,
“You see, through failing to get that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</span></i> that you ought to
have deserved, you have nearly made me behind time. Never
mind, you will get a very hearty one in the second part to make
up. Come down with me, wont you. It is far better fun in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>that family pew below than up here. Clinton Cleve is here,
isn’t he? Have you been introduced to him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man replied in the negative; Frithiof perceived
that the idea had cheered him up wonderfully, and knew that
a word from the veteran tenor might be of great use to a
beginner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll introduce you,” said Donati as they went down the
stairs. Frithiof held open the swing-doors for them and
watched with no small curiosity the greeting between Donati
and the other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artistes</span></i>. His manner was so very simple that it
was hard to realize that he was indeed the man about whom all
Europe was raving; but nevertheless he had somehow brought
a sort of new atmosphere into the place, and even Mr. Horner
seemed conscious of this, for he was less fidgety and fussy than
usual, and even seemed willing to keep in the background.
There was a hearty greeting to Madame Sardoni as she came
down the steps and a brisk little conversation in the interval;
then, having wrapped her shawl about her again, talking brightly
all the while, Donati picked up his music and stepped on to
the platform. It was only then that Frithiof realized how great
was his popularity, for he was greeted rapturously, and certainly
he well merited the thunder of applause which broke forth
again at the close of a song which had been given with unrivaled
delicacy of expression and with all the charm of his
wonderful voice. For the time Frithiof forgot everything;
he was carried far away from all consciousness of disgrace and
wretchedness, far away from all recollection of Mr. Horner’s
presence; he could only look in astonishment and admiration
at the singer, who stood laughing and talking with Sardoni,
periodically mounting the platform to bow his acknowledgments
to the audience, who still kept up their storm of
applause. When at length he had convinced them that he did
not intend to sing again, he began to talk to Clinton Cleve,
and soon had won for the young <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutant</span></i> a few minutes’ kindly
talk with the good-natured old singer who, though he had been
the idol of the British public for many years, had not forgotten
the severe ordeal of a first appearance. The young tenor
brightened visibly, and when he sang again acquitted himself
so well that he won the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</span></i> which Donati had prophesied.</p>

<p class='c000'>All went smoothly until, early in the second part, the Italian
baritone was to sing a song with violin obligato. By some unlucky
accident Frithiof forgot to place the music-stand for the
violinist; and perceiving this as soon as they were on the
platform, Donati himself brought it forward and put it in position.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>It was but a trifling occurrence, but quite sufficient to
rouse Mr. Horner. When the singer returned he apologized to
him profusely, and turned upon Frithiof with a rebuke, the
tone of which made Donati’s eyes flash.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pray do not make so much of it,” he said, with a touch of
dignity in his manner. Then returning again from one of his
journeys to the platform, and noticing the expression of Frithiof’s
face, he paused to speak to him for a moment before
returning to give the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</span></i> that was emphatically demanded.
It was not so much what he said as his manner of saying it
that caused Frithiof’s face to brighten, and brought a frown to
James Horner’s brow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is merely my duty to enlighten Signor Donati,” said the
little man to himself—“merely my duty!”</p>

  <h2 id='XXVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Carlo Donati had considerable insight into character; not
only had he been born with this gift, but his wandering life had
brought him into contact with all sorts and conditions of men,
and had been an excellent education to one who had always
known how to observe. He was, moreover, of so sympathetic
a temperament that he could generally tell in a moment
when trouble was in the air, and the ridiculously trivial affair
about the music-stand, which could not have dwelt in his mind
for a minute on its own account, opened his eyes to the relations
existing between Mr. Horner and the Norwegian. That something
was wrong with the latter he had perceived when Frithiof
had first spoken to him in the cloak-room, and now, having
inadvertently been the cause of bringing upon him a severe rebuke,
he was determined to make what amends lay in his power.</p>

<p class='c000'>He cut short Mr. Horner’s flattering remarks and reiterated
apologies as to the slight <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is of no consequence at all,” he said. “By the by, what
is the nationality of that young fellow? I like his face.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is Norwegian,” replied Mr. Horner, glancing at Frithiof,
who was arranging the platform for Madame Gauthier, the
pianiste.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think, no doubt, that I spoke too severely to him just
now, but you do not realize what a worthless fellow he is. My
partner retains him merely out of charity, but he has been proved
to be unprincipled and dishonest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The last few words reached Frithiof distinctly as he came down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>the steps; he turned ghastly pale, his very lips grew white; it
was as though some one had stabbed him as he re-entered the
little room, and the eyes that turned straight to the eyes of the
Italian were full of a dumb anguish which Donati never forgot.
Indignant with the utter want of kindness and tact which Mr.
Horner had shown, he turned abruptly away without making
the slightest comment on the words; but often through the
evening, when Frithiof was engrossed in other things, Donati
quietly watched him, and the more he saw of him the less was
he able to believe in the truth of the accusation. Meantime he
was waiting for his opportunity, but he was unable to get a
word with the Norwegian until the end of the concert, when he
met him on the stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you at liberty?” he asked. “Is your work here over?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof replied in the affirmative, and offered to look for
the great baritone’s carriage, imagining that this must be the
reason he had addressed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, as, to the carriage!” said Donati easily, “it will be
waiting at the corner of Sackville Street. But I wanted a few
minutes’ talk with you, and first of all to apologize for having
been the unwilling hearer of that accusation, which I am quite
sure is false.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof’s clouded face instantly cleared; all the old brightness
returned for a moment to his frank blue eyes, and forgetful
of the fact that he was not in Norway, and that Donati was the
idolized public singer, he grasped the hand of the Italian with
that fervent, spontaneous gratitude which is so much more
eloquent than words.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, now, is it possible for an outsider to help in unraveling
the mystery?” said Donati. “For when a man like you
is accused in this way I take it for granted there must be a
mystery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No one can possibly explain it,” said Frithiof, the troubled
look returning to his face. “I can’t tell in the least how the
thing happened, but appearances were altogether against me.
It is the most extraordinary affair, but God knows I had no
hand in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to hear all about it,” said Donati with that eagerness
of manner and warmth of interest which made him so devotedly
loved by thousands. “I am leaving England to-morrow; can’t
you come back and have supper with me now, and let me hear
this just as it all happened?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Even if he had wished to refuse, Frithiof could hardly have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>done so; and, as it was, he was so miserable that he would
have caught at much less hearty sympathy. They walked
along the crowded pavement toward Sackville Street, and had
almost reached the carriage when a conversation immediately
behind them became distinctly audible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They make such a fuss over this Donati,” said the speaker.
“But I happen to know that he’s a most disreputable character.
I was hearing all about him the other day from some one who
used to know him intimately. They say, you know, that—”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the conversation died away in the distance, and what
that curse of modern society—the almighty “They”—said as
to Donati’s private affairs remained unknown to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof glanced at the singer’s face. Apparently he had not
yet reached those sublime heights where insults cease from
troubling and slanders fail to sting. He was still young, and
naturally had the disadvantages as well as the immense gains
of a sensitive artistic temperament. A gleam of fierce anger
swept over his face, and was quickly succeeded by a pained
look that made Frithiof’s heart hot within him; in silence the
Italian opened the door of the carriage, signed to Frithiof to
get in, and they drove off together.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No matter,” said Donati in a minute, speaking reflectively,
and as if he were alone. “I do not sing for a gossiping public.
I sing for Christ.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that they should dare to say such a thing as that!”
exclaimed Frithiof, growing more and more indignant as his
companion’s serenity returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For one’s self,” said Donati, “it is—well—not much; but
for the sake of those belonging to one it certainly does carry a
sting. But every one who serves the public in a public capacity
is in the same boat. Statesmen, artists, authors, actors, all must
endure this plague of tongues. And, after all, it merely affects
one’s reputation, not one’s character. It doesn’t make one
immoral to be considered immoral, and it doesn’t make you a
thief to be considered dishonest. But now I want to hear
about this accusation of Mr. Horner’s. When did it all happen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the dim light Frithiof told his story; it was a relief to tell
it to sympathetic ears; Donati’s faith in him seemed to fill him
with new life, and though the strange events of that miserable
Monday did not grow any clearer in the telling, yet somehow
a rope began to dawn in his heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It certainly is most unaccountable,” said Donati, as the
carriage drew up before a pretty little villa in Avenue Road.
He paused to speak to the coachman. “We shall want the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>carriage in time to go to the 9.40 train at Charing Cross,
Wilson; good-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if you start so early,” said Frithiof, “I had better not
hinder you any longer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You do not hinder me; I am very much interested. You
must certainly come in to supper, and afterward I want to
hear more about this. How unlucky it was that the five-pound
note should have been changed that day by Sardoni!”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment the door was opened; Frithiof caught a
vision of a slim figure in a pale rose-colored tea gown, and
the loveliest face he had ever seen was raised to kiss Donati as
he entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How nice and early you are!” exclaimed a fresh, merry
voice. Then, catching sight of a stranger, and blushing a little,
she added, “I fancied it was Jack and Domenica you were
bringing back with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me introduce you to my wife, Herr Falck,” said Donati,
and Frithiof instantly understood that here lay the explanation
of the Italian’s faultless English, since, despite her foreign
name, it was impossible for a moment to mistake Francesca
Donati’s nationality.</p>

<p class='c000'>The house was prettily, but very simply, furnished, and about
it there was that indefinable air of home that Frithiof had so
often noticed in Rowan Tree House.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must forgive a very unceremonious supper, Herr
Falck,” said Francesca, herself making ready the extra place
that was needed at table. “But the fact is, I have sent all the
servants to bed, for I knew they would have to be up early to-morrow,
and they feel the traveling a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Much more than you and I do,” said Donati. “We have
grown quite hardened to it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then this is not your regular home?” asked Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it is our English home. We generally have five months
here and five at Naples, with the rest of the time either at Paris,
or Berlin, or Vienna. After all, a wandering life makes very
little difference when you can carry about your home with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And baby is the best traveler in the world,” said Donati,
“and in every way the most model baby. I think,” glancing
at his wife, “that she is as true a gipsy as Gigi himself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor Gigi! he can’t bear being left behind! By the by,
had you time to take him back to school before the concert, or
did he go alone?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had just time to take him,” said Donati, waiting upon
Frithiof as he talked. “He was rather doleful, poor old man;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>but cheered up when I told him that he was to spend the summer
holidays at Merlebank, and to come to Naples at Christmas.
It is a nephew of mine of whom we speak,” he explained to
Frithiof; “and, of course, his education has to be thought of,
and cannot always fit in with my engagements. You go in
very much for education in Norway, I understand?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof found himself talking quite naturally and composedly
about Norwegian customs and his former life, and it was not
until afterward that it struck him as a strange thing that on
the very day after his disgrace, when, but for Mr. Boniface’s
kindness he might actually have been in prison, he should be
quietly, and even for the time happily, talking of the old days.
Nor was it until afterward that he realized how much his
interview with the great baritone would have been coveted by
many in a very different position; for Donati would not go
into London society though it was longing to lionize him. His
wife did not care for it, and he himself said that with his art,
his home, and his own intimate friends, no time was left for
the wearing gayeties of the season. The world grumbled, but
he remained resolute, for though always ready to help any one
who was in trouble, and without the least touch of exclusiveness
about him, he could not endure the emptiness and wastefulness
of the fashionable world. Moreover, while applause that was
genuinely called forth by his singing never failed to give him
great pleasure, the flatteries of celebrity-hunters were intolerable
to him, so that he lost nothing and gained much by the quiet
life which he elected to lead. It was said of the great actor
Phelps that “His theater and his home were alike sacred to
him as the Temple of God.” And the same might well have
been said of Donati, while something of the calm of the Temple
seemed to lurk about the quiet little villa, where refinement
and comfort reigned supreme, but where no luxuries were
admitted. Francesca had truly said that the wandering life
made very little difference to them, for wherever they went
they made for themselves that ideal home which has been
beautifully described as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A world of strife shut out,</div>
      <div class='line'>A world of love shut in.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They did not linger long over the supper-table, for Frithiof
was suffering too much to eat, and Donati, like most of his
countrymen, had a very small appetite. Francesca with a
kindly good-night to the Norwegian went upstairs to her baby,
and the two men drew their chairs up to the open French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>window at the back of the room looking on to the little garden
to which the moonlight gave a certain mysterious charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have thought over it,” said Donati, almost abruptly, and
as if the matter might naturally engross his thoughts as much
as those of his companion. “But I can’t find the very slightest
clue. It is certainly a mystery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And must always remain so,” said Frithiof despairingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not think that at all. Some day all will probably be
explained. And be sure to let me hear when it is, for I shall
be anxious to know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A momentary gleam of hope crossed Frithiof’s face, but the
gloom quickly returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will never be explained,” he said. “I was born under
an unlucky star; at the very moment when all seems well
something has always interfered to spoil my life; and with my
father it was exactly the same—it was an undeserved disgrace
that actually killed him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, to his own astonishment, he found himself telling
Donati, bit by bit, the whole of his own story. The Italian
said very little, but he listened intently, and in truth possessed
exactly the right characteristics for a confidant—rare sympathy,
tact, and absolute faithfulness. To speak out freely to such a
man was the best thing in the world for Frithiof, and Donati,
who had himself had to battle with a sea of troubles, understood
him as a man who had suffered less could not possibly have
done.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is to this injustice,” said Frithiof, as he ended his tale,
“to this unrighteous success of the mercenary and scheming,
and failure of the honorable, that Christianity tells one to be
resigned. It is that which sets me against religion—which
makes it all seem false and illogical—actually immoral.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably Donati would not even have alluded to religion
had not his companion himself introduced the subject. It
was not his way to say much on such topics, but when he did
speak his words came with most wonderful directness and force.
It was not so much that he said anything noteworthy or novel,
but that his manner had about it such an intensity of conviction,
such rare unconsciousness, and such absolute freedom
from all conventionality. “Pardon me, if I venture to show
you a flaw in your argument,” he said quietly. “You say we are
told to be resigned. Very well. But what is resignation? It
was well defined once by a noble Russian writer who said that it
is ‘placing God between ourselves and our trouble.’ There is
nothing illogical in that. It is the merest common-sense.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>When finite things worry and perplex you, turn to the Infinite
from which they may be safely and peacefully viewed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof thought of those words which had involuntarily
escaped his companion after the remark of the passer-by in Piccadilly—“No
matter!—I do not sing for a gossiping world.”
He began to understand Donati better—he longed with an
intensity of longing to be able to look at life with such eyes
as his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These things are so real to you,” he said quickly. “But
to me they are only a hope—or, if for an hour or two real, they
fade away again. It may be all very well for you in your successful
happy life, but it is impossible for me with everything
against me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Impossible!” exclaimed Donati, his eyes flashing, and with
something in his tone which conveyed volumes to the Norwegian.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If not impossible at any rate very difficult,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” said Donati, his eyes full of sympathy. “It is
that to all of us. Don’t think I make light of your difficulties.
It is hard to seek God in uncongenial surroundings, in a life
harassed and misunderstood, and in apparent failure. But—don’t
let the hardness daunt you—just go on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words were commonplace enough, but they were full of
a wonderful power because there lurked beneath them the
assurance—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have been through where ye must go;</div>
      <div class='line'>I have seen past the agony.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know,” said Frithiof, smiling, “that is almost what
you said to me the first time I saw you. You have forgotten it,
but a year ago you said a few words to me which kept me from
making an end of myself in a fit of despair. Do you remember
coming to the shop about a song of Knight’s?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why yes,” said Donati. “Was that really you? It all
comes back to me now—I remember you found the song for me
though I had only the merest scrap of it, without the composer’s
name.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was just before my illness,” said Frithiof. “I never
forgot you, and recognized you the moment I saw you to-night.
Somehow you saved my life then just by giving me a hope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps no greater contrast could have been found than
these two men who, by what seemed a mere chance, had been
thrown together so strangely. But Donati almost always
attracted to himself men of an opposite type; as a rule it was
not the religious public that understood him or appreciated
him best, it was the men of the world, and those with whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>he came in contact in his professional life. To them his character
appealed in a wonderful way, and many who would have
been ashamed to show any enthusiasm as a rule, made an exception
in favor of this man, who had somehow fascinated
them and compelled them into a belief in goodness little in
accord with the cynical creed they professed.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Frithiof in his wretchedness, in his despairing rebellion
against a fate which seemed relentlessly to pursue him, the
Italian’s faith came with all the force of a new revelation. He
saw that the success, for which but a few hours ago he had cordially
hated the great singer, came from no caprice of fortune,
but from the way in which Donati had used his gifts; nor had
the Italian all at once leapt into fame, he had gone through a
cruelly hard apprenticeship, and had suffered so much that not
even the severe test of extreme popularity, wealth, and personal
happiness could narrow his sympathies, for all his life he would
carry with him the marks of a past conflict—a conflict which
had won for him the name of the “Knight-errant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The same single-hearted, generous nature which had fitted
him for that past work, fitted him now to be Frithiof’s friend.
For men like Donati are knights-errant all their life long, they
do not need a picturesque cause, or seek a paying subject, but
just travel through the world, succoring those with whom
they come in contact. The troubles of the Norwegian in his
prosaic shop-life were as much to Donati as the troubles of any
other man would have been; position and occupation were, to
him, very insignificant details; he did not expend the whole of
his sympathies on the sorrows of East London, and shut his
heart against the griefs of the rich man at the West End; nor
was he so engrossed with his poor Neapolitans that he could
not enter into the difficulties of a London shopman. He saw
that Frithiof was one of that great multitude who, through the
harshness and injustice of the world, find it almost impossible
to retain their faith in God, and, through the perfidy of one
woman, are robbed of the best safeguard that can be had in
life. His heart went out to the man, and the very contrast of
his present life with its intense happiness quickened his sympathies.
But what he said Frithiof never repeated to any one,
he could not have done it even had he cared to try. When at
length he rose to go Donati had, as it were, saved him from
moral death, had drawn him out of the slough of despond, and
started him with renewed hope on his way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait just one moment,” he said, as they stood by the door;
“I will give you one of my cards and write on it the Italian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>address. There! <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Valentino, Napoli.</span></i> Don’t forget to
write and tell me when this affair is all cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof grasped his hand, and, again thanking him, passed
out into the quiet, moonlit street.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The events of Monday had cast a shadow over Rowan-Tree
House. Cecil no longer sang as she went to and fro, Mr. Boniface
was paying the penalty of a stormy interview late on
Monday evening with his partner, and was not well enough to
leave his room, and Mrs. Boniface looked grave and sad, for
she foresaw the difficulties in which Frithiof’s disgrace would
involve others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish Roy had been at home,” she said to her daughter as,
on the Wednesday afternoon, they sat together in the verandah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil looked up for a moment from the little frock which she
was making for Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If he had been at home, I can’t help thinking that this never
would have happened,” she said. “And I have a sort of hope
that he will find out some explanation of it all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear, what explanation can there be but the one that
satisfies your father?” said Mrs. Boniface. “Frithiof must have
taken it in a fit of momentary aberration. But the whole
affair shows that he is not so strong yet as we fancied, and I
fear is a sign that all his life he will feel the effects of his illness.
It is that which makes me so sorry for them all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not believe that he took it,” said Cecil. “Nothing will
ever make me believe that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stitched away fast at the little frock, in a sudden panic,
lest the tears which burned in her eyes should attract her
mother’s notice. Great regret and sympathy she might allow
herself to show, for Frithiof was a friend and a favorite of
every one in the house; but of the grief that filled her heart
she must allow no trace to be seen, for it would make her mother
miserable to guess at the extent of her unhappiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you see him last night at the concert?” asked Mrs.
Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Cecil, choking back her tears; “just when he
arranged the platform. He was looking very ill and worn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is what I am so afraid of. He will go worrying over
this affair, and it is the very worst thing in the world for him.
I wish your father were better, and I would go and have a talk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>with Sigrid; but I hardly like to leave the house. How would
it be, dearie, if you went up and saw them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should like to go,” said Cecil quickly. “But it is no use
being there before seven, for Madame Lechertier has her classes
so much later in this hot weather.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, go up at seven, then, and have a good talk with her;
make her understand that we none of us think a bit the worse
of him for it, and that we are vexed with Cousin James for
having been so disagreeable and harsh. You might, if you like,
go to meet Roy; he comes back at half-past eight, and he will
bring you home again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil cheered up a good deal at this idea; she took Lance
round the garden with her, that he might help her to gather
flowers for Sigrid, and even smiled a little when of his own accord
the little fellow brought her a beautiful passion-flower
which he had gathered from the house wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This one’s for my dear Herr Frithiof!” he exclaimed,
panting a little with the exertions he had made to reach it. “It’s
all for his own self, and I picked it for him, ’cause it’s his very
favorite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know, Cecil,” said her mother, as she returned to the
seat under the verandah and began to arrange the flowers in
a basket, “I have another theory as to this affair. It happened
exactly a week after that day at the seaside when we all had
such a terrible fright about Roy and Sigrid. Frithiof had a
long run in the sun, which you remember was very hot that day;
then he had all the excitement of rowing out and rescuing them,
and though at the time it seemed no strain on him at all, yet I
think it is quite possible that the shock may have brought back
a slight touch of the old trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And yet it seemed to do him good at the time,” said Cecil.
“He looked so bright and fresh when he came back. Besides,
to a man accustomed as he once was to a very active life,
the rescue was, after all, no such great exertion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Boniface sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would grieve me to think that it was really caused by
that, but if it is so, there is all the more reason that they should
clearly understand that the affair makes no difference at all in
our opinion of him. It is just possible that it may be his meeting
with Lady Romiaux which is the cause. Sigrid told me
they had accidentally come across her again, and that it had
tried him very much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil turned away to gather some ferns from the rockery;
she could not bear to discuss that last suggestion. Later on in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the afternoon it was with a very heavy heart that she reached
the model lodgings and knocked at the door that had now
become so familiar to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild flew to greet her with her usual warmth. It was
easy to see that the child knew nothing of the trouble hanging
over the house. “What lovely flowers! How good of you!”
she cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Sigrid could not speak: she only kissed her, then turned
to Swanhild and the flowers once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are beautiful,” she said. “Don’t you think we might
spare some for Mrs. Hallifield? Run and take her some, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the child ran off she drew Cecil into their bedroom.
The two girls sat down together on the bed, but Sigrid, usually
the one to do most of the talking, was silent and dejected. Cecil
saw at once that she must take the initiative.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have been longing to come and see you,” she said. “But
yesterday was so filled up. Father and mother are so sorry for
all this trouble, and are very much vexed that Mr. Horner has
behaved badly about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are very kind,” said Sigrid wearily. “Of course most
employers would have prosecuted Frithiof, or, at any rate, discharged
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, Sigrid, what can be the explanation of it? Oh, surely
we can manage to find out somehow! Who can have put the
note in his pocket?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” cried Sigrid. “Do not you, too, hold Mr. Boniface’s
opinion, and think that he himself did it unintentionally?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I!” cried Cecil passionately. “Never! never! I am quite
sure he had nothing whatever to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid flung her arms round her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, how I love you for saying that!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the first real comfort that had come to her since their
trouble, and, although before Frithiof she was brave and cheerful,
in his absence she became terribly anxious and depressed.
But with the comfort there came a fresh care, for something
at that moment revealed to her Cecil’s secret. Perhaps it was
the burning cheek, that was pressed to hers, or perhaps a sort
of thrill in her companion’s voice as she spoke those vehement
words, and declared her perfect faith in Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought filled her with hot indignation against Blanche.
“Has she not only spoilt Frithiof’s life, but Cecil’s too?” she
said to herself. And in despair she looked on into the future,
and back into the sad past. “If it had not been for Blanche
he might have loved her—I think he would have loved her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>And oh! how happy she would have made him! how different
his whole life would have been! But now, with disgrace, and
debt, and broken health, all that is impossible for him. Blanche
has robbed him, too, of the very power of loving; she has
cheated him out of his heart. Her hateful flirting has ruined
the happiness of two people, probably of many more, for Frithiof
was not the only man whom she deceived. Oh! why does
God give women the power to bring such misery into the
world?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was recalled from her angry thoughts by Cecil’s voice;
it was sweet and gentle again now, and no longer vehement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know, Sigrid,” she said, “I have great hopes in
Roy. He will be home to-night, and he will come to it all like
an outsider, and I think, perhaps, he will throw some light on
the mystery. I shall meet him at Charing Cross, and as we
drive home, will tell him just what happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it to-night he comes home?” said Sigrid, with a depth of
relief in her tone. “Oh, how glad I am! But there is Swanhild
back again. You wont say anything before her, for we
have not mentioned it to her; there seemed no reason why she
should be made unhappy, and Frithiof likes to feel that one person
is unharmed by his trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, one can understand that,” said Cecil. “And Swanhild
is such a child, one would like to shelter her from all unhappiness.
Are you sure that you don’t mind my staying.
Would you not rather be alone to-night?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no, no,” said Sigrid. “Do stay to supper. It will
show Frithiof that you do not think any the worse of him for
this—it will please him so much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They went back to the sitting-room and began to prepare
the evening meal; and when, presently, Frithiof returned from
his work, the first thing he caught sight of on entering the room
was Cecil’s sweet, open-looking face. She was standing by the
table arranging flowers, but came forward quickly to greet him.
Her color was a little deeper than usual, her hand-clasp a little
closer, but otherwise she behaved exactly as if nothing unusual
had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have most unceremoniously asked myself to supper,”
she said, “for I have to meet Roy at half-past eight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is very good of you to come,” said Frithiof gratefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>His interview with Carlo Donati had done much for him,
and had helped him through a very trying day at the shop, but
though he had made a good start and had begun his new life
bravely, and borne many disagreeables patiently, yet he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>now miserably tired and depressed, just in the mood which
craves most for human sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lance sent you this,” she said, handing him the passion-flower
and making him smile by repeating the child’s words.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed touched and pleased; and the conversation at
supper-time turned a good deal on the children. He asked
anxiously after Mr. Boniface, and then they discussed the concert
of the previous night, and he spoke a little of Donati’s kindness
to him. Then, while Sigrid and Swanhild were busy in
the kitchen, she told him what she knew of Donati’s previous
life, and how it was that he had gained this extraordinary power
of sympathy and insight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never met any one like him,” said Frithiof. “He is a
hero and a saint, if ever there was one, yet without one touch
of the asceticism which annoys one in most good people. That
the idol of the operatic stage should be such a man as that
seems to me wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You mean because the life is a trying one?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; because such very great popularity might be supposed
to make a man conceited, and such an out-of-the-way voice
might make him selfish and heedless of others, and to be so
much run after might make him consider himself above ordinary
mortals, instead of being ready, as he evidently is, to be
the friend of any one who is in need.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am so glad you like him, and that you saw so much of
him,” said Cecil. “I wonder if you would just see me into a
cab now, for I ought to be going.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was pleased that she had asked him to do this; and when
she had said good-by to Sigrid and Swanhild, and was once
more alone with him, walking through the big court-yard, he
could not resist alluding to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is good of you,” he said, “to treat me as though I were
under no cloud. You have cheered me wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” she said, “it is not good of me—you must not think
that I believe you under a cloud at all. Nothing would ever
make me believe that you had anything whatever to do with
that five-pound note. It is a mystery that will some day be
cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is what Signor Donati said. He, too, believed in me
in spite of appearances being against me. And Sigrid says the
same. With three people on my side I can wait more patiently.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil had spoken very quietly, and quite without the passionate
vehemence which had betrayed her secret to Sigrid, for
now she was on her guard; but her tone conveyed to Frithiof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>just the trust and friendliness which she wished it to convey;
and he went home again with a fresh stock of hope and courage
in his heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Cecil paced gravely up and down the arrival platform
at Charing Cross. She, too, had been cheered by their
interview, but, nevertheless, the baffling mystery haunted her
continually, and in vain she racked her mind for any solution
of the affair. Perhaps the anxiety had already left its traces on
her face, for Roy at once noticed a change in her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Cecil, what has come over you? You are not looking
well,” he said, as they got into a hansom and set off on their
long drive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Father has not been well,” she said, in explanation. “And
I think we have all been rather upset by something that happened
on Monday afternoon in the shop.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she told him exactly what had passed, and waited
hopefully for his comments on the story. He knitted his brows
in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I had been at home,” he said. “If only James
Horner had not gone ferreting into it all this would never have
happened. Frithiof would have discovered his mistake, and
all would have been well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you don’t imagine that Frithiof put the note in his
pocket?” said Cecil, her heart sinking down in deep disappointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, who else could have put it there? Of course he must
have done it in absence of mind. Probably the excitement and
strain of that unlucky afternoon at Britling Gap affected his
brain in some way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot think that,” she said, in a low voice. “And, even
if it were so, that is the last sort of thing he would do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that is just the way when people’s brains are affected,
they do the most unnatural things; it is a known fact that young
innocent girls will often in delirium use the most horrible language
such as in real life they cannot possibly have heard.
Your honest man is quite likely under the circumstances to
become a thief. Is not this the view that my father takes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Cecil. “But somehow—I thought—I hoped—that
you would have trusted him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It doesn’t in the least affect my opinion of his character.
He was simply not himself when he did it. But one can’t
doubt such evidence as that. The thing was missed from the
till and found pinned into his pocket; how can any reasonable
being doubt that he himself put it there?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“It may be unreasonable to refuse to believe it—I cannot
help that,” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how can it possibly be explained on any other supposition?”
he urged, a little impatiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” said Cecil; “at present it is a mystery. But
I am as sure that he did not put it there as that I did not put it
there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Women believe what they wish to believe, and utterly disregard
logic,” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not only women who believe in him. Carlo Donati
has gone most carefully into every detail, and he believes
in him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I wish he would give me his recipe,” said Roy, with
a sigh. “I am but a matter-of-fact, prosaic man of business,
and cannot make myself believe that black is white, however
much I wish it. Have you seen Miss Falck? Is she very
much troubled about it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, she is so afraid that he will worry himself ill; but,
of course, she too believes in him. I think she suspects the
other man in the shop, Darnell—but I don’t see how he can
have anything to do with it, I must own.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a silence. Cecil looked sadly at the passers-by,
lovers strolling along happily in the cool of the evening, workers
just set free from the long day’s toil, children reveling in the
fresh sweet air. How very brief was the happiness and rest as
compared to the hard, wearing drudgery of most of those lives!
Love perhaps brightened a few minutes of each day, but in the
outside world there was no love, no justice, nothing but a hard,
grinding competition, while Sorrow and Sin, Sickness and Death
hovered round, ever ready to pounce upon their victims. It
was unlike her to look so entirely on the dark side of things, but
Frithiof’s persistent ill-luck had depressed her, and she was
disappointed by Roy’s words. Perhaps it was unreasonable of
her to expect him to share her view of the affair, but somehow
she had expected it, and now there stole into her heart a dreary
sense that everything was against the man she loved. In her
sheltered happy home, where a bitter word was never heard,
where the family love glowed so brightly that all the outside
world was seen through its cheering rays, sad thoughts of the
strength of evil seldom came, there was ever present so strong
a witness for the infinitely greater power of love. But driving
now along these rather melancholy roads, weighed down by
Frithiof’s trouble; a sort of hopelessness seized her, the thought
of the miles and miles of houses all round, each one representing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>several troubled, struggling lives, made her miserable. Personal
trouble helps us afterward to face the sorrows of humanity,
and shows us how we may all in our infinitesimal way help
to brighten other lives—take something from the world’s great
load of pain and evil. But at first there must be times of deadly
depression, and in these it is perhaps impossible not to yield a
little for the moment to the despairing thought that evil is rampant
and all-powerful. Poverty, and sin, and temptation are
so easily visible everywhere, and to be ever conscious of the
great unseen world encompassing us, and of Him who makes
both seen and unseen to work together for good, is not easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil Boniface, like every one else in this world, had, in spite
of her ideal home, in spite of all the comforts that love and
money could give her, to “dree her weird.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If Roy had seemed unsympathetic as they drove home it was
not because he did not feel keenly. He was indeed afraid to
show how keenly he felt, and he would have given almost anything
to have been able honestly to say that he, too, believed
in some unexplained mystery which should entirely free his
friend from reproach. But he could not honestly believe in
such a thing—it would have been as easy to him to believe in
the existence of fairies and hobgoblins. Since no such thing
as magic existed, and since Darnell had never been an assistant
of Maskelyne and Cooke, he could not believe that he had
anything to do with the five-pound note. Assuredly no one
but Frithiof could have taken it out of the till and carefully
pinned it to the lining of his waistcoat pocket. The more he
thought over the details of the story, the more irrational seemed
his sister’s blind faith. And yet his longing to share in her
views chafed and irritated him as he realized the impossibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>His mind was far too much engrossed to notice Cecil much,
and that, perhaps, was a good thing, for just then in her great
dejection any ordinarily acute observer could not have failed
to read her story. But Roy, full of passionate love for Sigrid,
and of hot indignation with James Horner for having been the
instrument of bringing about all this trouble, was little likely to
observe other people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why had he ever gone to Paris? he wondered angrily, when
his father or James Horner could have seen to the business
there quite as well. He had gone partly because he liked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>change, and partly because he was thankful for anything that
would fill up the wretched time while he waited for Sigrid’s
definite reply to his proposal. But now he blamed himself for
his restlessness, and was made miserable by the perception that
had he chosen differently all would have now been well.</p>

<p class='c000'>He slept little that night, and went up to business the next
morning in anything but a pleasant frame of mind, for he could
hardly resist his longing to go straight to Sigrid, and see how
things were with her. When he entered the shop Darnell was
in his usual place at the left-hand counter, but Frithiof was arranging
some songs on a stand in the center, and Roy was at
once struck by a change that had come over him; he could not
define it, but he felt that it was not in this way that he had
expected to find the Norwegian after a trouble which must
have been so specially galling to his pride. “How are you?”
he said, grasping his hand; but it was impossible before others
to say what was really in his heart, and it was not till an hour
or two later that they had any opportunity of really speaking
together. Then it chanced that Frithiof came into his room
with a message.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a Mr. Carruthers waiting to speak to you,” he
said, handing him a card; “he has two manuscript songs which
he wishes to submit to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell him I am engaged,” said Roy. “And that as for
songs, we have enough to last us for the next two years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are rather good; he has shown them to me. You
might just glance through them,” suggested Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall write a book some day on the sorrows of a music-publisher!”
said Roy. “How many thousands of composers
do you think there can be in this overcrowded country? No,
I’ll not see the man; I’m in too bad a temper; but you can
just bring in the songs, and I will look at them and talk to you
at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof returned in a minute, carrying the neat manuscripts
which meant so much to the composer and so little, alas! to
the publisher. Roy glanced through the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The usual style of thing,” he said. “Moon, man, and
maid, rill and hill, quarrel, kisses—all based on ‘So the Story
Goes.’ I don’t think this is worth sending to the reader.
What’s the other? Words by Swinburne: ‘If Love were what
the Rose is.’ Yes, you are right; this one is original; I rather
like that refrain. We will send it to Martino and see what he
thinks of it. Tell Mr. Carruthers that he shall hear about it
in a month or two. And take him back this moonlight affair.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Don’t go yet; he can wait on tenter-hooks a little longer. Of
course they have told me at home about all this fuss on Monday,
and I want you to promise me one thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that?” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That you wont worry about this miserable five-pound note.
That, if you ever think of it again, you will remember that my
father and I both regard the accident as if it had never happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you too take his view of the affair?” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it seems to me the only reasonable one; but don’t let
us talk of a thing that is blotted out and done away. It makes
no difference whatever to me, and you must promise that you
wont let it come between us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very good,” said Frithiof sadly; and, remembering
the hopelessness of arguing with one who took this view of his
trouble, he said no more, but went back to the poor composer,
whose face lengthened when he saw that his hands were not
empty, but brightened into radiant hope as Frithiof explained
that one song would really have the rare privilege of being
actually looked at. Being behind the scenes, he happened to
know that the vast majority of songs sent to the firm remained
for a few weeks in the house, and were then wrapped up again
and returned without even being glanced at. His intervention
had, at any rate, saved Mr. Carruthers from that hard fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And yet, poor fellow,” he reflected, “even if he does get
his song published it is a hundred to one that it will fall flat
and never do him any good at all; where one succeeds a thousand
fail; that seems the law of the world, and I am one of the
thousand. I wonder what is the use of it all!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some lines that Donati had quoted to him returned to his
mind:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Glorious it is to wear the crown</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of a deserved and pure success;</div>
      <div class='line'>He that knows how to fail has won</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A crown whose luster is not less.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His reflections were interrupted by the entrance of two customers,
evidently a very recently married couple, who had come
to choose a piano. Once again he had to summon Roy, who
stood patiently discoursing on the various merits of different
makers until at last the purchase had been made. Then, unable
any longer to resist the feverish impatience which had been
consuming him for so long, he snatched up his hat, left word
with Frithiof that he should be absent for an hour, and getting
into a hansom drove straight to the model lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>He felt a curious sense of incongruity as he walked across
the court-yard; this great business-like place was, as Sigrid had
once said, very much like a hive. An air of industry and orderliness
pervaded it, and Roy, in his eager impatience, felt as if
he had no right there at all. This feeling cast a sort of chill
over his happiness as he knocked at the familiar door. A voice
within bade him enter, and, emerging from behind the Japanese
screen, he found Sigrid hard at work ironing. She wore a large
brown holland apron and bib over her black dress, her sleeves
were turned back, revealing her round, white arms up to the
elbow, and the table was strewn with collars and cuffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought it was Mrs. Hallifield come to scrub the kitchen,”
she exclaimed, “or I should not have cried ‘Come in!’ so unceremoniously.
Cecil told us you were expected last night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you forgive me for coming at this hour?” he began
eagerly. “I knew it was the only time I was sure to find you
at home, and I couldn’t rest till I had seen you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was very good of you to come,” she said, coloring a little;
“you wont mind if I just finish my work while we talk?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The ironing might, in truth, have waited very well; but
somehow it relieved her embarrassment to sprinkle and arrange
and iron the “fine things” which, from motives of economy,
she washed herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have seen Frithiof,” he said, rather nervously. “He is
looking better than I had expected after such an annoyance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have spoken to him about it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only for a minute or two. After all, what is there to say
but that the whole affair must be forgotten, and never again
mentioned by a soul. I want so to make you understand that
it is to us nothing at all, that it is ridiculous to suppose that it
can affect our thoughts of him. It was the sort of thing that
might happen to any one after such an illness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid looked up at him. There was the same depth of disappointment
in her expression as there had been in Cecil’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You take that view of it,” she said slowly. “Somehow I
had hoped you would have been able to find the true explanation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If there were any other you surely know that I would seek
for it with all my might,” said Roy. “But I do not see how
any other explanation can possibly exist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are disappointed,” he said. “You thought I should
have taken the view that Carlo Donati takes. I only wish I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>could. But, you see, my nature is more prosaic. I can’t make
myself believe a thing when all the evidences are against it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not blaming you,” said Sigrid. “It is quite natural,
and of course most employers would have taken a far harder
view of the matter, and turned Frithiof off at a moment’s notice.
You and Mr. Boniface have been very kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t speak like that,” he exclaimed. “How can you
speak of kindness as between us? You know that Frithiof is
like a brother to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she said; “you are mistaken. I know that you are
fond of him; but, if he were like a brother to you, then you
would understand him; you would trust him through everything
as I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps she was unreasonable. But then she was very unhappy
and very much agitated; and women are not always
reasonable, or men either, for that matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” he said passionately, “you are not going to let this
come between us? You know that I love you with all my heart,
you know that I would do anything in the world for you, but
even for love of you I cannot make myself believe that black
is white.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not reproaching you because you do not think as
we think,” she said quickly. “But in one way this must come
between us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush!” he said imploringly; “wait a little longer. I will
not to-day ask you for your answer; I will wait as long as you
please; but don’t speak now while your mind is full of this
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I do not speak now, when do you think I shall be more
at leisure?” she asked coldly. “Oh! it seems a light thing to
you, and you are kind, and pass it over, and hush it up, but
you don’t realize how bitter it is to a Norwegian to have such
a shadow cast on his honesty. Do you think that even if you
forget it we can forget? Do you think that the other men in
the shop hold your view? Do you think that Mr. Horner
agrees with you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps not. What do I care for them?” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; that is just it. To you it is a matter of indifference,
but to Frithiof it is just a daily torture. And you would have
me think of happiness while he is miserable! You would have
me go and leave him when at any moment he may break down
again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would never ask you to leave him,” said Roy. “Our
marriage would not at all involve that. It would be a proof to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>him of how little this wretched business affects my opinion of
him; it would prove to all the world that we don’t regard it as
anything but the merest accident.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think the world would be convinced?” said Sigrid,
very bitterly. “I will tell you what it would say. It would say
that I had so entangled you that you could not free yourself,
and that, in spite of Frithiof’s disgrace, you were obliged to
marry me. And that shall never be said.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For heaven’s sake don’t let the miserable gossip, the worthless
opinion of outsiders, make our lives miserable. What do we
care for the world? It is nothing to us. Let them say what
they will; so long as they only say lies what difference does it
make to us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t know what you are talking about,” she said, and
for the first time the tears rushed to her eyes. “Your life has
been all sheltered and happy. But out there in Bergen I have
had to bear coldness and contempt and the knowledge that even
death did not shield my father from the poisonous tongues of
the slanderers. Lies can’t make the things they say true, but
do you think that lies have no power to harm you? no power
to torture you? Oh! before you say that you should just
try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her words pierced his heart; the more he realized the difficulties
of her life the more intolerable grew the longing to help
her, to shield her, to defy the opinion of outsiders for her sake.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But don’t you see,” he urged, “that it is only a form of
pride which you are giving way to? It is only that which is
keeping us apart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what if it is,” she replied, her eyes flashing. “A
woman has a right to be proud in such matters. Besides, it is
not only pride. It is that I can’t think of happiness while
Frithiof is miserable. My first duty is to him; and how could
I flaunt my happiness in his face? how could I now bring back
to him the remembrance of all his past troubles?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“At least wait,” pleaded Roy, once more; “at least let me
once more ask your final answer a few months hence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will wait until Frithiof’s name is cleared,” she said passionately.
“You may ask me again then, not before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then seeing the despair in his face her strength all at once
gave way, she turned aside trying to hide her tears. He stood
up and came toward her, her grief gave him fresh hope and
courage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” he said, “I will not urge you any more. It shall
be as you wish. Other men have had to wait. I suppose I,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>too, can bear it. I only ask one thing, tell me this once that
you love me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw the lovely color flood her cheek, she turned toward
him silently but with all her soul in her eyes. For a minute he
held her closely, and just then it was impossible that he could
realize the hopelessness of the case. Strong with the rapture
of the confession she had made, it was not then, nor indeed for
many hours after, that cold despair gripped his heart once
more. She loved him—he loved her with the whole strength of
his being. Was it likely that a miserable five-pound note could
for ever divide them? Poor Roy! as Sigrid had said, he had
lived such a sheltered life. He knew so little of the world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is of course a truism that we never fully appreciate what
we have, until some trouble or some other loss shows us all that
has grown familiar in a fresh light. Our life-long friends are
only perhaps valued at their true worth when some friendship
of recent growth has proved fleeting and full of disappointment.
And though many may love their homes, yet a home can
only be properly appreciated by one who has had to bear from
the outside world contempt and misunderstanding and harsh
judgment. Fond as he had been of his home before, Frithiof
had never until now quite realized what it meant to him. But
as each evening he returned from work, and from the severe
trial of an atmosphere of suspicion and dislike, he felt much as
the sailor feels when, after tossing about all day in stormy seas
he anchors at night in some harbor of refuge. Sigrid knew
that he felt this, and she was determined that he should not
even guess at her trouble. Luckily she had plenty to do, so
that it was impossible for her to sit and look her sorrow in the
face, or brood over it in idleness. It was with her certainly as
she went about her household work, with her as she and Swanhild
walked through the hot and crowded streets, and with her
as she played at Madame Lechertier’s Academy. But there
was something in the work that prevented the trouble from
really preying on her mind, she was sad indeed yet not in
despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless Madame Lechertier’s quick eyes noted at once
the change in her favorite.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are not well, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chérie</span></i>,” she said, “your face looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>worn. Why, my dear, I can actually see lines in your forehead.
At your age that is inexcusable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have a bad habit of wrinkling it up when I am worried
about anything,” she said. “To-day, perhaps, I am a little
tired. It is so hot and sultry, and besides I am anxious about
Frithiof, it is a trying time for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, this heat is trying to the strongest,” said Madame
Lechertier, fanning herself. “Swanhild, my angel, there are
some new bonbons in that box, help yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon it happened to be a children’s class, and
Madame Lechertier invariably regaled them in the intervals of
rest with the most delicious French sweetmeats. It was a pretty
sight to see the groups of little ones, and Swanhild in her
dainty Norwegian costume, handing the bonbons to each in
turn. Sigrid always liked to watch this part of the performance,
and perhaps the most comforting thought to her just then
was, that as far as Swanhild was concerned, the new life, in
spite of its restrictions and economies, seemed to answer so
well. The child was never happier than when hard at work at
the academy; even on this hot summer day she never complained;
and in truth the afternoons just brought the right
amount of variety into what would otherwise have been a very
monotonous life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” said the little girl, as they walked home together,
“is it true what you said to Madame Lechertier about Frithiof
feeling the heat? Is it really that which has made him so
grave the last few days?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is partly that,” replied Sigrid. “But he has a good deal
to trouble him that you are too young to understand, things that
will not bear talking about. You must try to make it bright
and cheerful at home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild sighed. It was not so easy to be bright and cheerful
all by one’s self, and of late Frithiof and Sigrid had been—as
she expressed it in the quaint Norse idiom—silent as lighted
candles. People talk a great deal about the happy freedom
from care which children can enjoy, but as a matter of fact
many a child feels the exact state of the home atmosphere, and
puzzles its head over the unknown troubles which are grieving
the elders, often magnifying trifles into most alarming and
menacing sources of danger. But Frithiof never guessed either
little Swanhild’s perplexities, or Sigrid’s trouble; when he returned
all seemed to him natural and homelike; and perhaps
it was as much with the desire to be still with them as from any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>recollection of Donati’s words, that on the following Sunday he
set off with them to the service held during the summer evenings
at Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class='c000'>What impression the beautiful service made on him Sigrid
could not tell, but the sermon was unluckily the very last he
ought to have heard. The learned Oxford professor who
preached to the great throng of people that night could have
understood very little how his words would affect many of his
hearers; he preached as a pessimist, he drew a miserable picture
of the iniquity and injustice of the world, all things were
going wrong, the times were out of joint, but he suggested no
remedy, he did not even indicate that there was another side
to the picture. The congregation dispersed. In profound
depression, Frithiof walked down the nave, and passed out
into the cool evening air. Miserable as life had seemed to him
before, it now seemed doubly miserable, it was all a great
wretched problem to which there was no solution, a purposeless
whirl of buying and selling, a selfish struggle for existence.
They walked past the Aquarium, the dingy side streets looked
unlovely enough on that summer night, and the dreary words
he had heard haunted him persistently, harmonizing only too
well with the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cui bono</span></i> that at all times was apt to suggest itself
to his mind. A wretched, clouded life in a miserable world,
misfortunes which he had never deserved eternally dogging his
steps, his own case merely one of a million similar or worse
cases. Where was the use of it all?</p>

<p class='c000'>A voice close beside him made him start. They were passing
a corner where two streets crossed each other, and the words
that fell upon his ear, spoken with a strange fervor yet with
deep reverence, were just these:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jesus, blessed Jesus!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced sharply round and saw a little crowd of people
gathered together; the words had been read from a hymn-book
by a man whose whole heart had been thrown into what he
read. They broke into Frithiof’s revery very strangely. Then
immediately the people began to sing the well-known hymn,
“The Great Physician now is near,” and the familiar tune,
which had long ago penetrated to Norway, brought to Frithiof’s
mind a host of old memories. Was it after all true that the
problem had been solved? Was it true that in spite of suffering
and sin and misery the pledge of ultimate victory had already
been given? Was it true that he whose uncongenial
work seemed chiefly to consist of passive endurance had yet a
share in helping to bring about the final triumph of good?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>From the words read by the street preacher, his mind involuntarily
turned to the words spoken to him a few days before
by a stage singer. Donati had spoken of living the life of the
crucified. He had said very little, but what he said had the
marvelous power of all essentially true things. He had spoken
not as a conventional utterer of platitudes, but as one man who
has fought and agonized and overcome, many speak to another
man who, bewildered by the confusion of the battle-field, begins
to doubt his own cause. And far more than anything
actually said there came to him the thought of Donati’s own
life, what he had himself observed of it, and what he had heard
of his story from Cecil. A wonderfully great admission was
made lately by a celebrated agnostic writer when he said that,
“The true Christian saint, though a rare phenomenon, is one
of the most wonderful to be witnessed in the moral world.”
Nor was the admission much qualified by the closing remark,—“So
lofty, so pure, so attractive that he ravishes men’s souls
into oblivion of the patent and general fact that he is an exception
among thousands of millions of professing Christians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof’s soul was not in the least ravished into oblivion of
this fact; he was as ready as before, perhaps more ready, to
admit the general selfishness of mankind, certainly he was
more than ever conscious of his own shortcomings, and daily
found pride and selfishness and ungraciousness in his own life
and character. But his love for Donati, his great admiration
for him, had changed his whole view of the possibilities of human
life. The Italian had doubtless been specially fortunate
in his parentage, but his life had been one of unusual temptation,
his extremely rapid change from great misery to the height
of popularity and success had alone been a very severe trial,
though perhaps it was what Frithiof had heard of his three
years in the traveling opera company that appealed to him
most. Donati was certainly saint and hero in one; but it was
not only men of natural nobility who were called to live this life
of the crucified. All men were called to it. Deep down in his
heart he knew that even for him it was no impossibility. And
something of Donati’s incredulous scorn as he flung back the
word “impossible” in his face, returned to him now and nerved
him to a fresh attack on the uncongenial life and the faulty
character with which he had to work. The week passed by
pretty well, and the following Sunday found him tired indeed,
but less down-hearted, and better able to keep at arm’s length
his old foe depression. For that foe, though chiefly due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>physical causes, can, as all doctors will bear witness, to be
a great extent held in check by spiritual energy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning was so bright that Sigrid persuaded him to take
a walk, and fully intending to return in an hour’s time to his
translating, he paced along the embankment. But either the
fine day, or the mere pleasure of exercise, or some sort of curiosity
to see a part of London of which he had heard a great
deal, lured him on. He crossed BlackFriars Bridge and
walked farther and farther, following the course of the river
eastward into a region, dreary indeed, yet at times picturesque,
with the river gleaming in the sunshine, and on the farther bank
the Tower—solid and grim, as befitted the guardian of so many
secrets of the past. Even here there was a quiet Sunday feeling,
while something familiar in the sight of the water and the
shipping carried him back in imagination to Norway, and there
came over him an intense longing for his own country. It was
a feeling that often took possession of him, nor could he any
more account for its sudden seizures than the Swiss can account
for that sick longing for his native mountains to which he is
often liable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s no use,” he thought to himself. “It will take me the
best part of my life to pay off the debts, and till they are paid
I can’t go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned his eyes from the river, as though by doing so he
could drag his thoughts from Norway, when to his astonishment
he all at once caught sight of his own national flag—the well
known blue and white cross on the red ground. His breath
came fast, he walked on quickly to get a nearer view of the
building from which the flag floated. Hurriedly pushing open
the door, he entered the place, and found himself in a church,
which presented the most curious contrast to churches in general,
for it was almost full of men, and the seven or eight
women who were there made little impression, their voices
being drowned in the hearty singing of the great bulk of the
congregation.</p>

<p class='c000'>They began to sing just as he entered; the tune was one
which he had known all his life, and a host of memories came
back to him as he heard once more the slow and not too melodious
singing, rendered striking, however, because of the fervor
of the honest Norsemen. Tears, which all his troubles had
not called forth, started now to his eyes as he listened to the
words which carried him right out of the foreign land back to
his childhood at Bergen.</p>

<p class='c000'>An onlooker, even a foreigner not understanding the language,
could not fail to have been touched by the mere sight of
this strange gathering in the heart of London,—the unpretentious
building, the antique look of the clergyman in his gown
and Elizabethan ruff, the ranks of men—numbering nearly four
hundred—with their grave, weather-beaten faces, the greater
number of them sailors, but with a sprinkling of business men
living in the neighborhood, and the young Norseman who had
just entered, with his pride broken down by memories of an old
home, his love of Norway leading him to the realization that he
was also a citizen of another country, and his stern face softened
to that expression which is always so full of pathos—the
expression of intent listening.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Norwegian church the subject of the sermon is arranged
throughout the year. On this second Sunday after Trinity it
was on the Gospel for the day, the parable of the Master of the
House who made a great supper, and of the guests who “all with
one consent began to make excuse.” There was nothing new
in what Frithiof heard; he had heard it all in the old times,
and, entirely satisfied with the happiness of self-pleasing, had
been among the rich who had been sent empty away. Now he
came poor and in need, and found that after all it is the hungry
who are “filled with good things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Very gradually, and helped by many flashes of light which
had from time to time come to him in his darkest hours, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>during the last two years groped his way from the vague and
somewhat flippant belief in a good providence, which he had
once announced to Blanche as his creed, and had learnt to believe
in the All-Father. His meeting with Donati had exercised,
and still continued to exercise, an extraordinary influence over
him; but it was not until this Sunday morning, in his own
national church, not until in his own language he once more
heard the entreaty, “Come, for all things are now ready!”
that he fully realized how he had neglected the life of Sonship.</p>

<p class='c000'>With an Infinite Love belonging to him by right, he had allowed
himself to be miserable, isolated, and bitter. To many
distinct commands he had turned a deaf ear. To One who
needed him and asked his love he had replied in the jargon of
the nineteenth century, but in the spirit of the old Bible story,
that practical matters needed him and that he could not come.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the preacher went on to speak of the Lord’s Supper,
and the distinct command that all should come to it, Frithiof
began to perceive for the first time that he had regarded this
service merely as the incomprehensible communication of a
great gift—whereas this was in truth only one side of it, and he,
also, had to give himself up to One who actually needed him.
It was characteristic of his honest nature that when he at last
perceived this truth he no longer made excuse but promptly
obeyed, not waiting for full understanding, not troubling at all
about controversial points, but simply doing what he recognized
as his duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when in a rapid survey of the past there came recollections
of Blanche and the wrong she had done him, he was almost
startled to find how quietly he could think of her, how possible
it had become to blot out all the resentful memories, all the reproachful
thoughts that for so long had haunted him. For the
first time he entirely forgave her, and in the very act of forgiving
he seemed to regain something of the brightness which she
had driven from his life, and to gain something better and
truer than had as yet been his.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the selfish element had died out of his love for her; there
remained only the sadness of thinking of her disgrace, and a
longing that, even yet, the good might prevail in her life. Was
there no recovery from such a fall? Was no allowance to be
made for her youth and her great temptations? If she really
repented ought not her husband once more to receive her; and
give her the protection which he alone could give?</p>

<p class='c000'>Kneeling there in the quiet he faced that great problem, and
with eyes cleared by love, with his pride altogether laid low, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>knowing what it was both to forgive and to be forgiven, he saw
beyond the conventional view taken by the world. There was
no escaping the great law of forgiveness laid down by Christ,
“If he repent, forgive him.” “Forgive even as also ye are
forgiven.” And if marriage was taken as a symbol of the union
between Christ and the Church, how was it possible to exclude
the idea of forgiveness for faithlessness truly repented of?
Had he been in Lord Romiaux’s place he knew that he must
have forgiven her, that if necessary he must have set the whole
world at defiance, in order once more to shelter her from the
deadly peril to which, alone, she must always be exposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so it happened that love turned to good even the early
passion that had apparently made such havoc of his life, and
used it now to raise him out of the thought of his own trouble and
undeserved disgrace, used it to lift him out of the selfishness
and hardness that for so long had been cramping an otherwise
fine nature.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps it was almost a relief both to Frithiof and to Sigrid
that, just at this time, all intercourse with Rowan Tree
House should become impossible. Lance and Gwen had
sickened with scarlatina, and, of course, all communication was
at end for some time to come; it would have been impossible
that things should have gone on as before after Frithiof’s
trouble: he was far too proud to permit such a thing, though
the Bonifaces would have done their best utterly to forget what
had happened. It would moreover have been difficult for Sigrid
to fall back in her former position of familiar friendship
after her last interview with Roy. So that, perhaps, the only
person who sighed over the separation was Cecil, and she was
fortunately kept so busy by her little patients that she had not
time to think much of the future. Whenever the thought did
cross her mind—“How is all this going to end?”—such miserable
perplexity seized her that she was glad to turn back to the
present, which, however painful, was at any rate endurable.
But the strain of that secret anxiety, and the physical fatigue
of nursing the two children, began to tell on her, she felt worn
and old, and the look that always frightened Mrs. Boniface
came back to her face—the look that made the poor mother
think of the two graves in Norwood Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the middle of August, Lance and Gwen had recovered,
and were taken down to the seaside, while Rowan Tree House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>was delivered into the hands of the painters and whitewashers
to be thoroughly disinfected. But in spite of lovely weather
that summer’s holiday proved a very dreary one. Roy was in
the depths of depression, and it seemed to Cecil that a great
shadow had fallen upon everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Robin,” said Mrs. Boniface, “I want you to take that child
to Switzerland for a month; this place is doing her no good
at all. She wants change and mountain air.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So the father and mother plotted and planned, and in September
Cecil, much against her will, was packed off to Switzerland
to see snow-mountains, and waterfalls, when all the time
she would far rather been seeing the prosaic heights of the
model lodging-houses, and the dull London streets. Still,
being a sensible girl, she did her best with what was put
before her, and, though her mind was a good deal with Sigrid
and Frithiof in their trouble and anxiety, yet physically
she gained great good from the tour, and came back with a
color in her cheeks which satisfied her mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By-the-by, dearie,” remarked Mrs. Boniface, the day after
her return, “your father thought you would like to hear the
<em>Elijah</em> to-night at the Albert Hall, and he has left you two
tickets.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Albani is singing, is she not?” cried Cecil. “Oh
yes; I should like to go of all things!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I tell you what we will do; we will send a card and
ask Mrs. Horner to go with you, for it’s the Church meeting
to-night, and father and I do not want to miss it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil could make no objection to this, though her pleasure
was rather damped by the prospect of having Mrs. Horner as
her companion. There was little love lost between them, for
the innate refinement of the one jarred upon the innate vulgarity
of the other, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a little after seven o’clock when Cecil drove to the
Horners’ house and was ushered into the very gorgeous drawing-room.
It was empty, and by a sort of instinct which she could
never resist, she crossed over to the fireplace and gazed up at
the clock, which ever since her childhood had by its ugliness
attracted her much as a moth is attracted to a candle. It was
a huge clock with a little white face and a great golden rock,
upon which golden pigs browsed with a golden swineherd in
attendance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear,” exclaimed Mrs. Horner, entering with a perturbed
face, “did not my letter reach you in time? I made
sure it would. The fact is, I am not feeling quite up to going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>out to-night. Could you find any one else, do you think, who
would go with you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil thought for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid would have liked it, but I know she is too busy just
now,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And, oh, my dear, far better go alone than take Miss
Falck!” said Mrs. Horner. “I shall never forget what I
endured when I took her with me to hear Corney Grain; she
laughed aloud, my dear; laughed till she positively cried, and
even went so far as to clap her hands. It makes me hot to
think of it even.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Horner belonged to that rather numerous section of
English people who think that it is a sign of good breeding to
show no emotion. She had at one time been rather taken by
Sigrid’s charming manner, but the Norwegian girl was far too
simple and unaffected, far too spontaneous, to remain long in
Mrs. Horner’s good books; she had no idea of enjoying things
in a placid, conventional, semi-bored way, and her clear, ringing
laugh was in itself an offense. Mrs. Horner herself never
gave more than a polite smile, or at times, when her powers of
restraint were too much taxed, a sort of uncomfortable gurgle
in her throat, with compressed lips, which gallantly tried to
strangle her unseemly mirth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I always enjoy going anywhere with Sigrid,” said Cecil,
who, gentle as she was, would never consent to be over-ridden
by Mrs. Horner. “It seems to me that her wonderful faculty
for enjoying everything is very much to be envied. However,
there is no chance of her going to-night; I will call and see
whether one of the Greenwoods is disengaged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So with hasty farewells she went off, laughing to herself as
the cab rattled along to think of Mrs. Horner’s discomfort and
Sigrid’s intense appreciation of Corney Grain. Fate, however,
seemed to be against her; her friends, the Greenwoods, were
out for the evening, and there was nothing left for it but to
drive home again, or else to go in alone and trust to finding
Roy afterward. To sacrifice her chance of hearing the <em>Elijah</em>
with Albani as soprano merely to satisfy Mrs. Grundy was too
much for Cecil. She decided to go alone, and, writing a few
words on a card asking Roy to come to her at the end of the
oratorio, she sent it to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artistes’</span></i> room by one of the attendants,
and settled herself down to enjoy the music, secretly rather
glad to have an empty chair instead of Mrs. Horner beside
her.</p>

<p class='c000'>All at once the color rushed to her cheeks, for, looking up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>she saw Frithiof crossing the platform; she watched him place
the score on the conductor’s desk, and turn to answer the question
of some one in the orchestra, then disappear again within
the swing-doors leading to the back regions. She wondered
much what he was thinking of as he went through his prosaic
duties so rapidly, wondered if his mind was away in Norway
all the time—whether autumn had brought to him, as she knew
it generally did, the strong craving for his old life of adventure—the
longing to handle a gun once more; or whether,
perhaps, his trouble had overshadowed even that, and whether
he was thinking instead of that baffling mystery which had
caused them all so much pain. And all through the oratorio she
seemed to be hearing everything with his ears; wondering how
the choruses would strike him, or hoping that he was in a good
place for hearing Albani’s exquisite rendering of “Hear ye,
Israel.” She wondered a little that Roy did not come to her,
or, at any rate, send her some message, and at the end of the
last chorus began to feel a little anxious and uncomfortable.
At last, to her great relief, she saw Frithiof coming toward her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your brother has never come,” he said, in reply to her
greeting. “I suppose this fog must have hindered him, for he
told me he should be here; and I have been expecting him
every moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is the fog so bad as all that?” said Cecil, rather anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was very bad when I came,” said Frithiof. “However,
by good luck, I managed to grope my way to Portland Road,
and came down by the Metropolitan. Will you let me see you
home?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, but it is so dreadfully out of your way. I
should be very glad if you would, only it is troubling you so
much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in her eager yet half-shy welcome, and in the
sense that she was one of the very few who really believed in
him, filled Frithiof with a happiness which he could scarcely
have explained to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will be giving me a very great pleasure,” he said. “I
expect there will be a rush on the trains. Shall we try for
a cab?”</p>

<p class='c000'>So they walked out together into the dense fog, Cecil with a
blissful sense of confidence in the man who piloted her so
adroitly through the crowd, and seemed so astonishingly cool
and indifferent amid the perilous confusion of wheels and
hoofs, which always appeared in the quarter where one least
expected them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>At last, after much difficulty, Frithiof secured a hansom, and
put her into it. She was secretly relieved that he got in too.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will come back with you if you will allow me,” he said;
“for I am not quite sure whether this is not a more dangerous
part of the adventure than when we were on foot. I never
saw such a fog! Why, we can’t even see the horse, much less
where he is going.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How thankful I am that you were here! It would have
been dreadful all alone,” said Cecil; and she explained to him
how Mrs. Horner had failed her at the last moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made no comment, but in his heart he was glad that both
Mrs. Horner and Roy should have proved faithless, and that
the duty of seeing Cecil home had devolved upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have not met my mother since she came back from
the sea,” said Cecil. “Are you still afraid of infection? The
house has been thoroughly painted and fumigated.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it is not that,” said Frithiof “but while this cloud is
still over me, I can’t come. You do not realize how it affects
everything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps she realized much more than he fancied, but she
only said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It does not affect your own home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, that’s true,” said Frithiof. “It has made me value
that more, and it has made me value your friendship more.
But, you see, you are the only one at Rowan Tree House who
still believes in me; and how you manage to do it passes my
comprehension—when there is nothing to prove me innocent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None of the things which we believe in most can be absolutely
proved,” said Cecil. “I can’t logically justify my belief
in you any more than in our old talks I could justify my belief
in the unseen world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you remember that first Sunday when I was staying
with you, and you asked me whether I had found a Norwegian
church!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, very well. It vexed me so much to have said anything
about it; but you see, I had always lived with people
who went to church or chapel as regularly as they took their
meals.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, do you know I was wrong; there is a Norwegian
church down near the Commercial Docks at Rotherhithe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then lured on by her unspoken sympathy, and favored
by the darkness, he told her of the strong influence which the
familiar old chorale had had upon him, and how it had carried
him back to the time of his confirmation—that time which to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>all Norwegians is full of deep meaning and intense reality, so
that even in the indifferentism of later years and the fogs of
doubt which pain and trouble conjure up, its memory still
lingers, ready to be touched into life at the very first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is too far for Sigrid and Swanhild to go very often, but
to me it is like a bit of Norway planted down in this great
wilderness of houses,” he said. “It was strange that I should
have happened to come across it so unexpectedly just at the
time when I most needed it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that surely is what always happens,” said Cecil. “When
we really need a thing we get it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You learned before I did to distinguish between needing
and wanting,” said Frithiof. “It comes to some people easily,
I suppose. But I, you see, had to lose everything before understanding—to
lose even my reputation for common honesty.
Even now it seems to be hardly possible that life should go on
under such a cloud as that. Yet the days pass somehow, and
I believe that it was this trouble which drove me to what I
really needed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is good of you to tell me this,” said Cecil. “It seems
to put a meaning into this mystery which is always puzzling me
and seeming so useless and unjust. By the by, Roy tells me
that Darnell has left.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Frithiof, “he left at Michaelmas. Things have
been rather smoother since then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t help thinking that his leaving just now is in direct
evidence against him,” said Cecil. “Sigrid and I suspected
him from the first. Do you not suspect him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he replied, “I do. But without any reason.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did he go?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“His wife was ill, and was ordered to a warmer climate.
He has taken a situation at Plymouth. After all, there is no
real evidence against him, and a great deal of evidence against
me. How is it that you suspect him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is because I know you had nothing to do with it,” said
Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had guessed what her answer would be, yet loved to hear
her say the words.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to him that the dense fog, and the long drive at
foot pace, and the anxiety to see the right way, and the manifold
difficulties and dangers of this night, resembled his own
life. And then it struck him how tedious the drive would have
been to him but for Cecil’s presence, and he saw how great a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>difference her trust and friendship made to him. He had
always liked her, but now gratitude and reverence woke a new
feeling in his heart. Blanche’s faithlessness had so crippled
his life that no thought of love in the ordinary sense of the
word—of love culminating in marriage—came to his mind.
But yet his heart went out to Cecil, and a new influence crept
into his life—an influence that softened his hardness, that
quieted his feverish impatience, that strengthened him to
endure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid and Swanhild have been away with Mme. Lechertier,
have they not?” asked Cecil, after a silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, they went to Hastings for a fortnight. We shut up
the rooms, and I went down to Herr Sivertsen, who was staying
near Warlingham, a charming little place in the Surrey
hills.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid told me you were with him, but I fancied she meant
in London.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; once a year he tears himself from his dingy den in
Museum Street, and goes down to this place. We were out of
doors most of the day, and in the evening worked for four or
five hours at a translation of Darwin which he is very anxious
to get finished. Hullo! what is wrong?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He might well ask, for the horse was kicking and plunging
violently. Shouts and oaths echoed through the murky darkness.
Then they could just make out the outline of another
horse at right angles with their own. He was almost upon
them, struggling frantically, and the shaft of the cab belonging
to him would have struck Cecil violently in the face had not
Frithiof seized it and wrenched it away with all his force.
Then, suddenly, the horse was dragged backward, their hansom
shivered, reeled, and finally fell on its side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil’s heart beat fast, she turned deadly white, just felt in
the horrible moment of falling a sense of relief when Frithiof
threw his arm around her and held her fast; then for an interval
realized nothing at all, so stunning was the violence with
which they came to the ground. Apparently both the cabs had
gone over and were lying in an extraordinary entanglement,
while both horses seemed to be still on their feet, to judge by
the sounds of kicking and plunging. The danger was doubled
by the blinding fog, which made it impossible to realize where
one might expect hoofs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you hurt?” asked Frithiof anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied Cecil, gasping for breath. “Only shaken.
How are we to get out?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>He lifted her away from him, and managed with some difficulty
to scramble up. Then, before she had time to think of
the peril, he had taken her in his arms, and, rashly perhaps,
but very dexterously, carried her out of danger. Had she not
trusted him so entirely it would have been a dreadful minute
to her; and even as it was she turned sick and giddy as she
was lifted up, and heard hoofs in perilous proximity, and felt
Frithiof cautiously stepping out into that darkness that might
be felt, and swaying a little beneath her weight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wont you put me down?—I am too heavy for you,” she
said. But, even as she spoke, she felt him shake with laughter
at the idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I could carry you for miles, now that we are safely out of
the wreck,” he said. “Here is a curbstone, and—yes, by good
luck, the steps of a house. Now, shall we ring up the people
and ask them to shelter you while I just lend a hand with the
cab?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, it is so late, I will wait here. Take care you don’t
get hurt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He disappeared into the fog, and she understood him well
enough to know that he would keenly enjoy the difficulty of
getting matters straight again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think accidents agree with you,” she said laughingly,
when by and by he came back to her, seeming unusually
cheerful.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t help laughing now to think of the ridiculous way in
which both cabs went down and both horses stood up,” he
said. “It is wonderful that more damage was not done. We
all seem to have escaped with bruises, and nothing is broken
except the shafts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us walk home now,” said Cecil “Does any one know
whereabout we are?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The driver says it is Battersea Bridge Road, some way
from Rowan Tree House, you see, but, if you would not be too
tired, it would certainly be better not to stay for another cab.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So they set off, and, with much difficulty, at length groped
their way to Brixton, not getting home till long after midnight.
At the door Frithiof said good-by, and for the first time since
the accident Cecil remembered his trouble; in talking of many
things she had lost sight of it, but now it came back to her
with a swift pang, all the harder to bear because of the happiness
of the last half-hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must not go back without resting and having something
to eat,” she said pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“You are very kind,” he replied, “but I can not come in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I shall be so unhappy about you, if you go all that long
way back without food; come in, if it is only to please me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in her tone touched him, and at that moment the
door was opened by Mr. Boniface himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Cecil,” he cried. “We have been quite anxious
about you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof saw me home because of the fog,” she explained.
“And our hansom was overturned at Battersea, so we have had
to walk from there. Please ask Frithiof to come in, father, we
are so dreadfully cold and hungry, yet he will insist on going
straight home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s not to be thought of,” said Mr. Boniface. “Come in,
come in, I never saw such a fog.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So once more Frithiof found himself in the familiar house
which always seemed so homelike to him, and for the first time
since his disgrace he shook hands with Mrs. Boniface; she was
kindness itself, and yet somehow the meeting was painful and
Frithiof wished himself once more in the foggy streets. Cecil
seemed intuitively to know how he felt, for she talked fast and
gayly as though to fill up the sense of something wanting which
was oppressing him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure we are very grateful to you,” said Mrs. Boniface,
when she had heard all about the adventure, and his rescue of
Cecil. “I can’t think what Cecil would have done without
you. As for Roy, finding it so foggy and having a bad headache,
he came home early and is now gone to bed. But come
in and get warm by the fire. I don’t know why we are all
standing in the hall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She led the way into the drawing-room, and Cecil gave a cry
of astonishment, for, standing on the hearth-rug was a little
figure in a red dressing-gown, looking very much like a wooden
Noah in a toy ark.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Lance,” she cried, “you up at this time of night!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The little fellow flew to meet her and clung round her neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I really couldn’t exackly help crying,” he said, “for I
couldn’t keep the tears out of my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He woke up a few minutes ago,” said Mrs. Boniface, “and
finding your bed empty thought that something dreadful had
happened to you, and as nurse was asleep I brought him down
here, for he was so cold and frightened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time Lance had released Cecil and was clinging to
Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen and me’s been ill,” he said proudly, “and I’ve grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>a whole inch since you were here last. My throat doesn’t
hurten me now at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The happy unconsciousness of the little fellow seemed to
thaw Frithiof at once, the wretched five-pound note ceased to
haunt him as he sat with Lance on his knee, and he ate without
much thought the supper that he had fancied would choke
him. For Lance, who was faithful to his old friends, entirely
refused to leave him, but serenely ate biscuits and begged stray
sips of his hot cocoa, his merry childish talk filling up the gaps
in a wonderful way and setting them all at their ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Had you not better stay here for the night?” said Mrs.
Boniface presently. “I can’t bear to think of your having
that long walk through the fog.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very kind,” he said, “but Sigrid would be frightened
if I didn’t turn up,” and kissing Lance, he sat him down on
the hearthrug, and rose to go. Cecil’s thanks and warm hand-clasp
lingered with him pleasantly, and he set out on his walk
home all the better for his visit to Rowan Tree House.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Had it not been for the fog his long walk might have made
him sleepy, but the necessity of keeping every faculty on the
alert and of sharply watching every crossing and every landmark
made that out of the question. Moreover, now that he
had quite recovered from his illness it took a great deal to tire
him, and, whenever he did succumb, it was to mental worry,
never to physical fatigue. So he tramped along pretty cheerfully,
rather enjoying the novelty of the thing, but making as
much haste as he could on account of Sigrid. He had just
reached the outer door of the model lodgings and was about
to unlock it with the key which was always furnished to those
whose work detained them beyond the hour of closing, when
he was startled by something that sounded like a sob close by
him. He paused and listened; it came again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who is there?” he said, straining his eyes to pierce the
thick curtain of fog that hung before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The figure of a woman approached him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, sir,” she said, checking her sobs, “have you the key,
and can you let me in?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I have a key. Do you live here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir, but I’m sister to Mrs. Hallifield. Perhaps you know
Hallifield, the tram conductor. I came to see him to-night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>because he was taken so ill, but I got hindered setting out
again, and didn’t allow time to get back to Macdougal’s. I’m
in his shop, and the rule at his boarding-house is that the door
is closed at eleven and mayn’t be opened any more, and when
I got there sir, being hindered with the fog, it was five minutes
past.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And they wouldn’t let you in?” asked Frithiof. “What
an abominable thing—the man ought to be ashamed of himself
for having such a rule! Come in; why you must be half-frozen!
I know your sister quite well!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can never thank you enough,” said the poor girl. “I
thought I should have had to stay out all night! There’s a
light, I see, in the window; my brother-in-law is worse, I
expect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is wrong with him?” asked Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, he’s been failing this long time,” said the girl; “it’s
the long hours of the trams he’s dying of. There’s never any
rest for them you see, sir; winter and summer, Sunday and
week-day they have to drudge on. He’s a kind husband and a
good father too, and he will go on working for the sake of
keeping the home together, but it’s little of the home he sees
when he has to be away from it sixteen hours every day.
They say they’re going to give more holidays and shorter hours,
but there’s a long time spent in talking of things, it seems to
me, and in the meanwhile John’s dying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof remembered how Sigrid had mentioned this very
thing to him in the summer when he had told her of his disgrace;
he had been too full of his own affairs to heed her
much, but now his heart grew hot at the thought of this pitiable
waste of human life, this grinding out of a larger dividend at the
cost of such terrible suffering. It was a sign that his new life
had actually begun when, instead of merely railing at the injustice
of the world, he began to think what he himself could
do in this matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps they will want the doctor fetched. I will come
with you to the door and you shall just see,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the girl thanking him, knocked at her sister’s door,
spoke to some one inside, and returning, asked him to come in.
To his surprise he found Sigrid in the little kitchen; she was
walking to and fro with the baby, a sturdy little fellow of a
year old.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are back at last,” she said, “I was getting quite anxious
about you. Mr. Hallifield was taken so much worse to-day,
and hearing the baby crying I came in to help.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“How about the doctor? Do they want him fetched?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, he came here about ten o’clock, and he says there is
nothing to be done; it is only a question of hours now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment the poor wife came into the kitchen; she was
still quite young, and the dumb anguish in her face brought
the tears to Sigrid’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What, Clara!” she exclaimed, perceiving her sister, “you
back again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was too late,” said the girl, “and they had locked me out.
But it’s no matter now that the gentleman has let me in here.
Is John worse again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’ll not last long,” said the wife, “and he be that set on
getting in here to the fire, for he’s mortal cold. But I doubt
if he’s strength to walk so far.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof, you could help him in,” said Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you, sir? I’ll thank you kindly if you will,” said Mrs.
Hallifield, leading the way to the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof followed her, and glancing toward the bed could
hardly control the awed surprise which seized him as for the
first time he saw a man upon whom the shadow of death had
already fallen. Once or twice he had met Hallifield in the
passage setting off to his work in the early morning, and he
contrasted his recollection of the brisk, fair-complexioned,
respectable-looking conductor, and this man propped up with
pillows, his face drawn with pain, and of that ghastly ashen
hue which is death’s herald.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Norwegian gentleman is here, and will help you into
the kitchen, John,” said the wife, beginning to swathe him in
blankets.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, sir,” said the man gratefully. “It’s just a
fancy I’ve got to die in there by the fire, though I doubt I’ll
never get warm any more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof carried him in gently and set him down in a cushioned
chair drawn close to the fire; he seemed pleased by the change
of scene, and looked round the tidy little room with brightening
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a nice little place!” he said. “I wish I could think
you would keep it together, Bessie, but with the four children
you’ll have a hard struggle to live.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For the first time she broke down and hid her face in her
apron. A look of keen pain passed over the face of the dying
man, he clinched and unclinched his hands. But Sigrid, who
was rocking the baby on the other side of the hearth, bent forward
and spoke to him soothingly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“Don’t you trouble about that part of it,” she said. “We
will be her friends. Though we are poor yet there are many
ways in which we can help her, and I know a lady who will
never let her want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He thanked her with a gratitude that was pathetic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m in a burial club,” he said, after a pause, stretching out
his nerveless fingers toward the fire; “she’ll have no expenses
that way; they’ll bury me very handsome, which’ll be a satisfaction
to her, poor girl. I’ve often thought of it when I saw
a well-to-do looking funeral pass alongside the tram, but I
never thought it would come as soon as this. I’m only going
in thirty-five, which isn’t no great age for a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The work was too much for you,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, it’s the truth you speak, and there’s many another
in the same boat along with me. It’s a cruel hard life. But
then, you see, I was making my four-and-six a day, and if I
gave up I knew it meant starvation for the wife and the children;
there is thousands out of work, and that makes a man
think twice before giving in—spite of the long hours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And he did get six shillings a day at one time,” said the
wife looking up, “but the company’s cruel hard, sir, and just
because he had a twopence in his money and no ticket to
account for its being there they lowered him down to four-and-six
again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, that did seem to me hard; I’ll not deny, I swore a bit
that day,” said Hallifield. “But the company never treats us
like men, it treats us like slaves. They might have known me
to be honest and careful, but it seems as if they downright
liked to catch a fellow tripping, and while that’s so there’s
many that’ll do their best to cheat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But is nothing being done to shorten the hours, to make
people understand how frightful they are?” asked Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, miss, there’s Mrs. Reaney working with all her
might for us,” said Hallifield. “But you see folks are hard to
move, and if we had only the dozen hours a day that we ought
to have and every other Sunday at home, why, miss, they’d
perhaps not get nine per cent. on their money as they do
now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are no better than murderers!” said Frithiof hotly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Hallifield, “so it has seemed to me sometimes.
But I never set up to know much; I’ve had no time for book-learning,
nor for religion either, barely time for eating and
sleeping. I don’t think God Almighty will be hard on a fellow
that has done his best to keep his wife and children in comfort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and I’ll not complain if only He’ll just let me sit still and do
nothing for a bit, for I’m mortal tired.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been talking eagerly, and for the time his strength
had returned to him, but now his head dropped forward, and
his hands clutched convulsively at the blankets.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a great cry the poor wife started forward and flung her
arms round him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s going!” she sobbed. “He’s going! John—oh,
John!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nine per cent. on their money!” thought Frithiof. “My
God! if they could but see this!”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>By-and-by, when he had done all that he could to help, he
went back to his own room, leaving Sigrid still with the poor
widow. The scene had made a deep impression on him; he
had never before seen any one die, and the thought of poor
Hallifield’s pathetic confession that he had had no time for
anything, but the toil of living, returned to him again and again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a death-bed that ought not to have been,” he reflected.
“It came for the hateful struggle for wealth. Yet
the shareholders are no worse than the rest of the world, it is
only that they don’t think, or, if they do think for a time, allow
themselves to be persuaded that the complaints are exaggerated.
How easily men let themselves be hoodwinked by vague statements
and comfortable assurances when they want to be persuaded,
when it is to their own interest to let things go on as
before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, quite unable to sleep, he lay thinking of the great
problems which had so often haunted him, the sharp contrasts
between too great wealth and too great poverty, the unequal
chances in life, the grinding competition, the ineffable sadness
of the world. But his thoughts were no longer tainted by bitterness
and despair, because, though he could not see a purpose
in all the great mysteries of life, yet he trusted One who
had a purpose, One who in the end must overcome all evil, and
he knew that he himself was bound to live and could live a life
which should help toward that great end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three days later poor Hallifield’s “handsome funeral” set
out from the door of the model lodgings, and Frithiof, who had
given up his half-holiday to go down to the cemetery, listened
to the words of the beautiful service, thinking to himself how
improbable it was that the tram-conductor had ever had the
chance of hearing St. Paul’s teaching on the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was there not something wrong in a system which should so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>tire out a man that the summit of his wishes on his dying day
should be but an echo of the overworked woman whose epitaph
ended with—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m going to do nothing for ever and ever”?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How could this great evil of the overwork of the many, and
the too great leisure of the few, be set right? A socialism
which should compulsorily reduce all to one level would be
worse than useless. Love of freedom was too thoroughly
ingrained in his Norse nature to tolerate that idea for a moment.
He desired certain radical reforms with his whole heart, but he
saw that they alone would not suffice—nothing but individual
love, nothing but the consciousness of individual responsibility,
could really put an end to the misery and injustice of the present
system. In a word, the only true remedy was the life of
Sonship.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One December day another conclave was held in Mr. Boniface’s
private room. Mr. Boniface himself sat with his arm
chair turned round toward the fire, and on his pleasant, genial
face there was a slight cloud, for he much disliked the prospect
of the discussion before him. Mr. Horner stood with his back
to the mantel-piece, looking even more pompous and conceited
than usual, and Roy sat at the writing-table, listening attentively
to what passed, and relieving his feelings by savagely digging
his pen into the blotting-pad to the great detriment of its point.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is high time we came to an understanding on this matter,”
Mr. Horner was saying. “Do you fully understand that when
I have once said a thing I keep to it? Either that Norwegian
must go, or when the day comes for renewing our partnership
I leave this place never to re-enter it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not wish to have any quarrel with you about the matter,”
said Mr. Boniface. “But I shall certainly not part with
Falck. To send him away now would be most cruel and unjustifiable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be nothing of the sort,” retorted Mr. Horner hotly.
“It would be merely following the dictates of common-sense
and fairness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is precisely the point on which you and I do not agree,”
said Mr. Boniface with dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not only his dishonesty that has set me against him,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>continued Mr. Horner. “It is his impertinent indifference,
his insufferable manner when I order him to do anything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have never myself found him anything but a perfect
gentleman,” said Mr. Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gentleman! Oh! I’ve no patience with all that tomfoolery!
I want none of your gentlemen; I want a shopman
who knows his place and can answer with proper deference.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You do not understand the Norse nature,” said Roy.
“Now here in the newspaper, this very day, is a good sample
of it.” He unfolded the morning paper eagerly and read them
the following lines, taking a wicked delight in the thought of
how it would strike home:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Their noble simplicity and freedom of manners bear witness
that they have never submitted to the yoke of a conqueror,
or to the rod of a petty feudal lord; a peasantry at once so
kind-hearted, so truly humble and religious, and yet so nobly
proud, where pride is a virtue, who resent any wanton affront
to their honor or dignity. As an instance of this, it may be
mentioned that a naturalist, on finding that his hired peasant
companions had not done their work of dredging to his satisfaction,
scolded them in violent and abusive language. The men
did not seem to take the slightest notice of his scolding. ‘How
can you stand there so stupidly and apathetically, as though
the matter did not concern you?’ said he, still more irritated.
‘It is because we think, sir, that such language is only a sign
of bad breeding,’ replied an unawed son of the mountains, whom
even poverty could not strip of the consciousness of his dignity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You insult me by reading such trash,” said Mr Horner, all
the more irritated because he knew that Roy had truth on his
side, and that he had often spoken to Frithiof abusively. “But
if you like to keep this thief in your employ—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Excuse me, but I can not let that expression pass,” said
Mr. Boniface. “No one having the slightest knowledge of
Frithiof Falck could believe him guilty of dishonesty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, then, this lunatic with a mania for taking money that
belongs to other people—this son of a bankrupt, this designing
foreigner—if you insist on keeping him I withdraw my capital
and retire. I am aware that it is a particularly inconvenient
time to withdraw money from the business, but that is your
affair. ‘As you have brewed so you must drink.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It may put me to some slight inconvenience,” said Mr.
Boniface. “But as far as I am concerned I shall gladly submit
to that rather than go against my conscience with regard to
Falck. What do you say, Roy?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“I am quite at one with you, father,” replied Roy, with a keen
sense of enjoyment in the thought of so quietly baffling James
Horner’s malicious schemes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This designing fellow has made you both his dupes,” said
Mr. Horner furiously. “Someday you’ll repent of this and
see that I was right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No one replied, and, with an exclamation of impatient disgust,
James Horner took up his hat and left the room, effectually
checkmated. Frithiof, happening to glance up from his
desk as the angry man strode through the shop, received so
furious a glance that he at once realized what must have passed
in the private room. It was not, however, until closing time
that he could speak alone with Roy, but the moment they were
out in the street he turned to him with an eager question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What happened to Mr. Horner to-day?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He heard a discourse on the Norwegian character which
happened to be in the <cite>Daily News</cite>, by good luck,” said Roy,
smiling. “By-the-by, it will amuse you, take it home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And, drawing the folded paper from his coat-pocket, he
handed it to Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He gave me such a furious glance as he passed by, that I
was sure something had annoyed him,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind, it is the last you will have from him,” said
Roy, rubbing his hands with satisfaction. “He has vowed
that he will never darken our doors again. Think what a reign
of peace will set in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has really retired, then?” said Frithiof. “I was afraid
it must be so. I can’t stand it, Roy; I can’t let you make
such a sacrifice for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sacrifice! stuff and nonsense!” said Roy cheerfully. “I
have not felt so free and comfortable for an age. We shall be
well rid of the old bore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But his capital?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Goes away with him,” said Roy; “it will only be a slight
inconvenience; probably he will hurt himself far more than he
hurts us, and serve him right, too. If there’s a man on earth I
detest it is my worthy cousin James Horner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof naturally shared this sentiment, yet still he felt very
sorry that Mr. Horner had kept his word and left the firm, for
all through the autumn he had been hoping that he might relent
and that his bark would prove worse than his bite. The
sense of being under such a deep obligation to the Bonifaces
was far from pleasant to him; however, there seemed no help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>for it and he could only balance it against the great relief of
being free from James Horner’s continual provocations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later in the evening, when supper was over, he went round
to see Herr Sivertsen about some fresh work, and on returning
to the model lodgings found Swanhild alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is Sigrid?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She has gone in to see the Hallifields,” replied the little
girl, glancing up from the newspaper which she was reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You look like the picture of Mother Hubbard’s dog, that
Lance is so fond of,” he said, smiling. “Your English must
be getting on, or you wouldn’t care for the <cite>Daily News</cite>. Are
you reading the praises of the Norse character?”</p>

<p class='c000'>As he spoke he leaned over her shoulder to look at the letter
which Roy had mentioned; but Swanhild had turned to the
inner sheet and was deep in what seemed to her strangely interesting
questions and answers continued down three columns.
A hurried glance at the beginning showed Frithiof in
large type the words, “The Romiaux Divorce Case.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He tore the paper away from her, crushed it in his hands,
and threw it straight into the fire. Swanhild looked up in sudden
panic, terrified beyond measure by his white face and flashing
eyes, terrified still more by the unnatural tone in his voice
when he spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are never to read such things,” he said vehemently.
“Do you understand? I am your guardian and I forbid you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was only that I wanted to know about Blanche,” said
Swanhild, conscious that, in some way she could not explain,
he was unjust to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, unluckily, the mention of Blanche’s name was just the
one thing that Frithiof could not bear; he lost his self-control.
“Don’t begin to argue,” he said fiercely. “You ought to
have known better than to read that poisonous stuff! You
ought to be ashamed of yourself!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was more than Swanhild could endure; with a sense
of intolerable injury she left the parlor, locked herself into her
bedroom, and cried as if her heart would break, taking good
care, however, to stifle her sobs in the pillow, since she, too,
had her full share of the national pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is ungenerous of him to hate poor Blanche so,” she
thought to herself. “Whatever she has done I shall always
love her—always. And he had no right to speak so to me, it
was unfair—unfair! I didn’t know it was wrong to read the
paper. Father would never have scolded me for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And in this she was quite right; only a very inexperienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“guardian” could have made so great a mistake as to reproach
her and hold her to blame for quite innocently touching pitch.
Perhaps even Frithiof might have been wiser had not the sudden
shock and the personal pain of the discovery thrown him
off his balance.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Sigrid returned in a few minutes she found him pacing
the room as restlessly as any wild beast at the Zoo.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof,” she said, “what is the matter with you? Have
you and Herr Sivertsen had a quarrel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The matter is this” he said hoarsely, checking his restlessness
with an effort and leaning against the mantel-piece as he
talked to her. “I came back just now and found Swanhild
reading the newspaper—reading the Romiaux Divorce Case,
thoroughly fascinated by it too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had no idea it had begun,” said Sigrid. “We so seldom
see an English paper; how did this one happen to be lying
about?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Roy gave it to me to look at an account of Norway; I
didn’t know this was in it too. However, I gave Swanhild a
scolding that she’ll not soon forget.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid looked up anxiously, asking what he had said and
listening with great dissatisfaction to his reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You did very wrong indeed,” she said warmly. “You forget
that Swanhild is perfectly innocent and ignorant; you have
wronged her very cruelly, and she will feel that, though she
wont understand it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Frithiof, although he was proud and hasty, was neither
ungenerous nor conceited; as soon as he had cooled down and
looked at the question from this point of view, he saw at once
that he had been wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will go to her and beg her pardon,” he said at length.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, not just yet,” said Sigrid, with the feeling that men
were too clumsy for this sort of work. “Leave her to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She rapped softly at the bedroom door and after a minute’s
pause heard the key turned in the lock. When she entered the
room was quite dark, and Swanhild, with her face turned away,
was vigorously washing her hands. Sigrid began to hunt for
some imaginary need in her box, waiting till the hands were
dry before she touched on the sore subject. But presently she
plunged boldly into the heart of the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Swanhild,” she said, “you are crying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said the child, driving back the tears that started
again to her eyes at this direct assertion, and struggling hard to
make her voice cheerful.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>But Sigrid put her arm round her waist and drew her close.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof told me all about it, and I think he made a great
mistake in scolding you. Don’t think any more about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But this was more than human nature could possibly promise;
all that she had read assumed now a tenfold importance
to the child. She clung to Sigrid, sobbing piteously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said I ought to be ashamed of myself, but I didn’t
know—I really didn’t know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was his great mistake,” said Sigrid quietly. “Now,
if he had found me reading that report he might justly have
reproached me, for I am old enough to know better. You see,
poor Blanche has done what is very wrong, she has broken her
promise to her husband and brought misery and disgrace on
all who belong to her. But to pry into all the details of such
sad stories does outsiders a great deal of harm; and now you
have been told that, I am sure you will never want to read
them again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This speech restored poor little Swanhild’s self-respect, but
nevertheless Sigrid noticed in her face all through the evening
a look of perplexity which made her quite wretched. And
though Frithiof was all anxiety to make up for his hasty scolding,
the look still remained, nor did it pass the next day; even
the excitement of dancing the shawl dance with all the pupils
looking on did not drive it away, and Sigrid began to fear that
the affair had done the child serious harm. Her practical,
unimaginative nature could not altogether understand Swanhild’s
dreamy, pensive tendencies. She herself loved one or
two people heartily, but she had no ideals, nor was she given to
hero-worship. Swanhild’s extravagant love for Blanche, a love
so ardent and devoted that it had lasted more than two years
in spite of every discouragement, was to her utterly incomprehensible;
she was vexed that the child should spend so much
on so worthless an object; it seemed to her wrong and unnatural
that the love of that pure, innocent little heart should be
lavished on such a woman as Lady Romiaux. It was impossible
for her to see how even this childish fancy was helping to
mold Swanhild’s character and fit her for her work in the
world; still more impossible that she should guess how the
child’s love should influence Blanche herself and change the
whole current of many lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>But so it was; and while the daily life went on in its usual
grooves—Frithiof at the shop, Sigrid busy with the household
work, playing at the academy, and driving away thoughts of
Roy with the cares of other people—little Swanhild in desperation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>took the step which meant so much more than she understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Sunday afternoon. Frithiof had gone for a walk with
Roy, and Sigrid had been carried off by Madame Lechertier
for a drive. Swanhild was alone, and likely to be alone for
some time to come. “It is now or never,” she thought to herself;
and opening her desk, she drew from it a letter which
she had written the day before, and read it through very carefully.
It ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir.</span>—It says in your prayer-book that if any can
not quiet their conscience, but require comfort and counsel,
they may come to any discreet and learned minister and open
their grief, thus avoiding all scruple and doubtfulness. I am
a Norwegian; not a member of your church, but I have often
heard you preach; and will you please let me speak to you,
for I am in a great trouble?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“I am, sir, yours very truly,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Swanhild Falck</span>.”</div>

<p class='c007'>Feeling tolerably satisfied with this production, she inclosed
it in an envelope, directed it to “The Rev. Charles Osmond,
Guilford Square,” put on her little black fur hat and her thick
jacket and fur cape, and hurried downstairs, leaving the key
with the door-keeper, and making all speed in the direction of
Bloomsbury.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild, though in some ways childish, as is usually the
case with the youngest of the family, was in other respects a
very capable little woman. She had been treated with respect
and consideration, after the Norwegian custom; she had been
consulted in the affairs of the little home commonwealth; and
of course had been obliged to go to and from school alone
every day, so she did not feel uncomfortable as she hastened
along the quiet Sunday streets; indeed, her mind was so taken
up with the thought of the coming interview that she scarcely
noticed the passers-by, and only paused once, when a little
doubtful whether she was taking the nearest way, to ask the
advice of a policeman.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length she reached Guilford Square, and her heart began
to beat fast and her color to rise. All was very quiet here;
not a soul was stirring; a moldy-looking statue stood beneath
the trees in the garden; hospitals and institutions seemed to
abound; and Mr. Osmond’s house was one of the few private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>houses still left in what, eighty years ago, had been a fashionable
quarter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild mounted the steps, and then, overcome with shyness,
very nearly turned back and gave up her project; however,
though shy she was plucky, and making a valiant effort,
she rang the bell, and waited trembling, half with fear, half
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The maid-servant who opened the door had such a pleasant
face that she felt a little reassured.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is Mr. Osmond at home?” she asked, in her very best
English accent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, miss,” said the servant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then will you please give him this,” said Swanhild, handing
in the neatly written letter. “And I will wait for an
answer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was shown into a dining-room, and after a few minutes
the servant reappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Osmond will see you in the study, miss,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Swanhild, summoning up all her courage, followed her
guide, her blue eyes very wide open, her cheeks very rosy, her
whole expression so deprecating, so pathetic, that the veriest
ogre could not have found it in his heart to be severe with her.
She glanced up quickly, caught a glimpse of a comfortable
room, a blazing fire, and a tall, white-haired, white-bearded
man who stood on the hearth rug. A look of astonishment
and amusement just flitted over his face, then he came forward
to meet her, and took her hand in his so kindly that
Swanhild forgot all her fears, and at once felt at home with
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am so glad to see you,” he said, making her sit down in
a big chair by the fire. “I have read your note, and shall be
very glad if I can help you in any way. But wait a minute.
Had you not better take off that fur cape, or you will catch
cold when you go out again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild obediently took it off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t know,” she said, “whether you heard confessions
or not, but I want to make one if you do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled a little, but quite kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, in the ordinary sense I do not hear confessions,” he
said. “That is to say, I think the habit of coming regularly
to confession is a bad habit, weakening to the conscience and
character of the one who confesses, and liable to abuse on the
part of the one who hears the confession. But the words you
quoted in your letter are words with which I quite agree, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>if you have anything weighing on your mind and think that I
can help you, I am quite ready to listen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild seemed a little puzzled by the very home-like and
ordinary appearance of the study. She looked round uneasily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” said Charles Osmond, seeing her bewildered look.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was wondering if people kneel down when they come to
confession,” said Swanhild, with a simple directness which
charmed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kneel down to talk to me!” he said, with a smile in his
eyes. “Why, no, my child; why should you do that? Sit
there by the fire and get warm, and try to make me understand
clearly what is your difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is just this,” said Swanhild, now entirely at her ease.
“I want to know if it is ever right to break a promise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly it is sometimes right,” said Charles Osmond.
“For instance, if you were to promise me faithfully to pick
some one’s pocket on your way home, you would be quite
right to break a promise which you never had any right to
make. Or if I were to say to you, ‘On no account tell any
one at your home that you have been here talking to me,’ and
you agreed, yet such a promise would rightly be broken, because
no outsider has any right to come between you and your
parents.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father and mother are dead,” said Swanhild. “I live
with my brother and sister, who are much older than I am—I
mean really very old, you know—twenty-three. They are my
guardians; and what troubles me is that last summer I did
something and promised some one that I would never tell
them, and now I am afraid I ought not to have done it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, ever since then there has seemed to be a difference
at home, and, though I thought what I did would help Frithiof
and Sigrid, and make every one happier, yet it seems to have
somehow brought a cloud over the house. They have not
spoken to me about it, but ever since then Frithiof has had
such a sad look in his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it anything wrong that you promised to do—anything
that in itself was wrong, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no,” said Swanhild; “the only thing that could have
made it wrong was my doing it for this particular person.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am afraid I can not follow you unless you tell me a little
more definitely. To whom did you make this promise? To
any one known to your brother and sister?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, they both know her; we knew her in Norway, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>she was to have married Frithiof; but when he came over to
England he found her just going to be married to some one
else. I think it was that which changed him so very much;
but perhaps it was partly because at the same time we lost all
our money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do your brother and sister still meet this lady?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no; they never see her now, and never speak of her;
Sigrid is so very angry with her because she did not treat Frithiof
well. But I can’t help loving her still, she is so very beautiful;
and I think, perhaps, she is very sorry that she was so
unkind to Frithiof.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you come across her again?” asked Charles
Osmond.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite accidentally in the street, as I came home from
school,” said Swanhild. “She asked me so many questions
and seemed so sorry to know that we were so very poor, and
when she asked me to do this thing for her I only thought how
kind she was, and I did it, and promised that I would never
tell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She had no right to make you promise that, for probably
your brother would not care for you still to know her, and certainly
would not wish to be under any obligation to her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; that was the reason why it was all to be a secret,”
said Swanhild. “And I never quite understood that it was
wrong till the other day, when I was reading the newspaper
about her, and Frithiof found me and was so very angry, and
threw the paper in the fire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did the lady’s name happen to be in the paper?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid said it was because she had broken her promise to
her husband; it was written in very big letters—‘The Romiaux
Divorce Case,’” said Swanhild.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Osmond started. For some minutes he was quite
silent. Then, his eyes falling once more on the wistful little
face that was trying so hard to read his thoughts, he smiled
very kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know where Lady Romiaux is living?” he asked.
But Swanhild had no idea. “Well, never mind; I think I can
easily find out, for I happen to know one of the barristers who
was defending her. You had better, I think, sit down at my
desk and write her just a few lines, asking her to release you
from your promise; I will take it to her at once, and if you
like you can wait here till I bring back the answer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that will be giving you so much trouble,” said Swanhild,
“and on Sunday, too, when you have so much to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>He took out his watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall have plenty of time,” he said, “and if I am fortunate
enough to find Lady Romiaux, you shall soon get rid of
your trouble.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Having established Swanhild at the writing-table, Charles
Osmond left her for a few minutes and went up to the drawing-room;
it was one of those comfortable, old-fashioned rooms
which one seldom sees now, and resting on the sofa was one of
those old-world ladies whose sweet graciousness has such a
charm to the more restless end of the nineteenth century. No
less than four generations were represented in the room, for by
the fire sat Charles Osmond’s daughter-in-law, and on her knee
was her baby son—the delight of the whole house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Erica,” he said, coming toward the hearth, “strangely
enough the very opportunity I wanted has come. I have been
asked to see Lady Romiaux on a matter connected with some
one who once knew her, so you see it is possible that after all
your wish may come true, and I may be of some use to her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Erica looked up eagerly, her face which in repose was sad,
brightened wonderfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How glad I am, father! You know Donovan always said
there was so much that was really good in her, if only some one
could draw it out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did the case end?” asked Mrs. Osmond.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It ended in a disagreement of the jury,” replied her son,
“Why, I can’t understand, for the evidence was utterly against
her, according to Ferguson. I am just going round to see him
now, and find out her address from him, and in the mean time
there’s a dear little Norwegian girl in my study, who will wait
till I bring back an answer. Would you like her to come up
here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” said Erica, “by all means let us have her if she
can talk English. Rae is waking up, you see, and we will
come down and fetch her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild had just finished her letter when the door of the
study opened, and looking up she saw Charles Osmond once
more, and beside him a lady who seemed to her more lovely
than Blanche; she was a good deal older than Lady Romiaux
and less strikingly beautiful, but there was something in her
creamy-white coloring and short auburn hair, something in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>mingled sadness and sweetness of her face that took Swanhild’s
heart by storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Brian Osmond, and this is
my grandson,” said Charles Osmond, allowing Rae’s tiny fingers
to play with his long white beard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you come upstairs and stay with us till Mr. Osmond
comes back?” said Erica, shaking hands with her, and wondering
not a little what connection there could be between this
fair-haired, innocent little Norse girl and Lady Romiaux. And
then seeing that Swanhild was shy she kept her hand in hers
and led her up to the drawing-room, where, with the baby to
play with, she was soon perfectly happy, and chattering away
fast enough to the great amusement of old Mrs. Osmond, who
heard the whole story of the model lodgings, of the dancing
classes, and of the old home in Norway.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean while Charles Osmond had reached his friend’s
chambers, and to his great satisfaction found him in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As far as I know,” replied Mr. Ferguson, “Lady Romiaux
is still in lodgings in George Street.” He drew a card from
his pocket-book and handed it to the clergyman. “That’s
the number; and to my certain knowledge she was there
yesterday. Her father wont have anything to do with
her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor child!” said Charles Osmond, half to himself, “I wonder
what will become of her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Ferguson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, she’s brought it all on herself,” he said. “There is
no doubt whatever that she is guilty, and how the jury disagreed
I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Osmond did not stay to discuss the matter, but made
the best of his way to George Street, and sent in his card with
a request that Lady Romiaux would, if possible, see him on a
matter of business.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a minute or two he was ushered into a drawing-room,
which had the comfortless air of most lodging-house rooms;
standing on the hearthrug was a young, delicate-looking girl;
for a moment he did not recognize her as the Lady Romiaux
whose portraits were so well known, for trouble had sadly
spoiled her beauty, and her eyelids were red and swollen, either
with want of sleep or with many tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>She bowed, then meeting his kindly eyes, the first eyes she
had seen for so long which did not stare at her in hateful curiosity,
or glance at her with shrinking disapproval, she came
quickly forward and put her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“For what reason can you have come?” she exclaimed;
“you of all men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was struck with the wild look in her great dark eyes, and
intuitively knew that other work than the delivery of little
Swanhild’s letter awaited him here.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you say, ‘Of all men’ in that tone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because you are one of the very few men who ever made
me wish to do right,” she said quickly. “Because I used sometimes
to come to your church—till—till I did not dare to come,
because what you said made me so miserable!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My poor child,” he said; “there are worse things than to
be miserable; you are miserable now, but your very misery
may lead you to peace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” she sobbed, sinking down on the sofa and hiding
her face in her hands. “My life is over—there is nothing left
for me. And yet,” she cried, lifting her head and turning her
wild eyes toward him, “yet I have not the courage to die, even
though my life is a misery to me and a snare to every one I
come across.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you alone here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; my father and mother will have nothing to say to
me—and there is no one else—I mean no one else that I
would have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He breathed more freely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must not say your life is over,” he replied. “Your
life in society is over, it is true, but there is something much
better than that which you may now begin. Be sure that if you
wish to do right it is still possible for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but I can’t trust myself.” she sobbed. “It will be so
very difficult all alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leave that for God to arrange,” he said. “Your part is
to trust to Him and try your best to do right. Tell me, do
you not know my friend Donovan Farrant, the member for
Greyshot?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She brushed the tears from her eyes and looked up more
quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I met him once at a country house in Mountshire,” she said,
“He and his wife were there just for two days, and they were
so good to me. I think he guessed that I was in danger then,
for one day he walked with me in the grounds, and he spoke
to me as no one had ever spoken before. He saw that my husband
and I had quarreled, and he saw that I was flirting out of
spite with—with—well, no matter! But he spoke straight out,
so that if it hadn’t been for his wonderful tact and goodness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>I should have been furious with him. And he told me how
the thing that had saved him all through his life was the influence
of good women; and just for a few days I did want to
be good, and to use my power rightly. But the Farrants went
away, and I vexed my husband again and we had another quarrel,
and when he was gone down to speak at Colonel Adair’s
election, I went to stay, against his wish, at Belcroft Park;
and when I had done that, it seemed as if I were running right
down a steep hill and really couldn’t stop myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But now,” said Charles Osmond, “you must begin to climb
the hill once more. You must be wondering through all this
time what was the errand that brought me here. I brought you
this letter from a little Norwegian girl—Swanhild Falck. In
the midst of your great trouble I dare say her trouble will seem
very trifling, still I hope you will be able to release her from her
promise, for it is evidently weighing on her mind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s another instance of the harm I do wherever I go,”
said poor Blanche, reading the letter, “and in this case I was
really trying to undo the past, very foolishly as I see now. Tell
Swanhild that she is quite free from her promise, and that if it
has done harm I am sorry. But I always do harm! Do you remember
that story of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s about the daughter
of the botanist, who was brought up on the juices of a beautiful
poison-plant, and who poisoned with her breath every one
that came near her? I think I am like that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I remember it,” he replied. “A weird, unwholesome story.
But if I remember right, the heroine died herself rather than
poison others.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, and that is what I wish to do,” she said, with once
more that look in her eyes which had startled him. “But I am
a coward; I haven’t the courage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait,” he said gravely: “there is a real truth in your idea,
but do not set about it in a wrong way. To seek physical
death would only be to take another wrong step. It is not
you, but your selfishness that must die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if I were not what you would call selfish, if I did not
love to attract men and make them do just what I please, if I
did not enjoy the feeling that they are in love with me, I should
no longer be myself,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You would no longer be your false self,” he replied.
“You would be your true self. Do you think God made you
beautiful that you might be a snare in the world? He made
you to be a joy and a blessing, and you have abused one of his
best gifts.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>She began to cry again, to sob piteously, almost like a child.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Osmond spoke once more, and there was a great
tenderness in his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have found now that self-pleasing brings misery to
yourself and every one else. I know you wish to do right, but
you must do more than that; you must resolutely give your
body, soul, and spirit to God, desiring only to do his will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked up once more, speaking with the vehemence of
despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” she said, “it seems all real now while I talk to you,
but I know it will fade away, and the temptations will be much
more strong. You don’t know what the world is—you are good,
and you have no time to see with your own eyes how, underneath
all that is so respectable, it is hollow and wicked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be your own fault if you are not stronger than the
temptations with which God allows you to be assailed,” he
said. “You loathe and fear evil, and that is a step in the right
direction, but now you must turn right away from it, and learn
to look at purity, and goodness, and love. Don’t believe that
vice is to conquer—that is the devil’s lie. The strength of the
Infinite the love of the All-Father will conquer—and that love
and that strength are for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” sobbed Blanche, “for a woman who has dishonored
her name—a woman cast out of society?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Osmond took her hand in his strong, firm clasp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, my child,” he said, “they are for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a long silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And now,” he said, at length, “unless you have any other
friends to whom you would rather go, I am going to ask you to
come home with me. I can promise you at least rest and shelter,
and a welcome from my dear old mother, who, being very near
to the other world, does not judge people after the custom of
this one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” she said, with a look of mingled relief and perplexity,
“how can I let you do so much for a mere stranger? Oh, I
should like to come—but—but—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are no longer a stranger,” he replied, “And you must
not refuse me this. You shall see no one at all if you prefer
it. Ours is a busy house, but in some ways it is the quietest
house in London. My son and his wife live with us. They,
too, will be so glad if we can be of any use to you. Come, I
can not leave you here in this loneliness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean that I am to come now?” she said, starting up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, if you will,” he replied. “But I will go and call a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>hansom; and since I am in rather a hurry, perhaps you will
let your maid follow with your things later on in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So in a few minutes they were driving together to Guilford
Square, and Blanche was transplanted from her miserable loneliness
into the heart of one of the happiest homes in the country.
Leaving her in the study, Charles Osmond went in search
of Swanhild.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is all right,” he said, handing her a little note in Blanche’s
writing; and while the child eagerly read it he turned to his
daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you tell them to get the spare room ready, Erica,
dear?” he said. “I have persuaded Lady Romiaux to stay
with us for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild caught the words, and longed to ask to see Blanche,
but she remembered that Sigrid would not like it; and then,
with a sudden recollection that the afternoon was almost over,
and that she must go home, she thanked Charles Osmond,
reluctantly parted with the baby, kissed old Mrs. Osmond and
Erica, who made her promise to come and see them again, and
hurried back to the model lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her happiness and relief, and the pleasurable excitement of
having learned to know a new and delightful family, were slightly
clouded by the uncomfortable thought of the confession that
lay before her. What would Frithiof and Sigrid say to her?
And how should she put into words the story of what she more
and more felt to have been a wrong and foolish, and very
childish scheme of help?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, how I wish it were over!” she thought, to herself, as
she marched on to her disagreeable work like a little Trojan.
Big Ben was striking five as she crossed the court-yard. She
had been away from home more than two hours. She hurried
on to the porter’s office, and asked breathlessly for the key.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Falck took it ten minutes ago,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Swanhild turned away with a sigh and a little shiver,
and began very slowly to mount the stone stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! what will he say to me?” she thought, as she clasped
Blanche’s note fast in her little cold hands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Although she had climbed the stairs so slowly, poor Swanhild
was still out of breath when she reached the door leading
into the little parlor; she paused a moment to recover herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>and, hearing voices within, became a degree more miserable,
for she had counted upon finding Frithiof alone. Clearly Sigrid
must also have returned, and, indeed, things were even
worse than that, for as she opened the door and emerged round
the Japanese screen she saw Roy standing by the fire; for this
she had been utterly unprepared, and, indeed, it was very seldom
that he came now to the model lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At last!” exclaimed Frithiof, “why, Swanhild, where on
earth have you been to? We were just thinking of having you
cried.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were preparing an advertisement to appear in all the
papers to-morrow morning,” said Roy, laughing, “and were
just trying to agree as to the description; you’ll hardly believe
me, but your guardian hadn’t the least notion what color your
eyes are.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof drew her toward him, smiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me see now in case she is ever lost again,” he said, but
noticing a suspicious moisture in the blue eyes he no longer
teased her, but made her sit down on his knee and drew off her
gloves.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the matter, dear?” he said, “you look cold and
tired; where have you been to?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have been to see Mr. Osmond,” said Swanhild, “you
know we often go to his church, Sigrid and I, and there was
something I wanted to ask him about. Last summer I made
a promise which I think was wrong, and I wanted to know
whether I might break it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did he say?” asked Frithiof, while Sigrid and Roy
listened in silent astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said that a wrong promise ought to be broken, and he
managed to get me leave to speak from the person to whom I
made the promise. And now I am going to tell you about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof could feel how the poor little thing was trembling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t be frightened, darling,” he said, “just tell us everything
and no one shall interrupt you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She gave his hand a grateful little squeeze and went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It happened just after we had come back from the sea last
June. I was coming home from school on Saturday morning
when, just outside the court-yard, I met Lady Romiaux. Just
for a moment I did not know her, but she knew me directly,
and stopped me and said how she had met you and Sigrid at a
party and had ever since been so miserable to think that we
were so poor, and somehow she had found out our address, and
wanted to know all about us, only when she actually got to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>door she did not like to come in. And she said she was so
glad to see me, and asked all sorts of questions, and when she
heard that you meant to pay off the debts she looked so sad,
and she said that the bankruptcy was all her fault, and she
asked how much I thought you had got toward it, and seemed
quite horrified to think what a little it was, and what years the
work would take. And then she said to me that she wanted
to help, too, just a little, only that you must never know, and
she thought I could easily pay in a five-pound note to your account
at the bank, she said, without your knowing anything
about it. She made me promise to do it secretly, and never to
tell that it was from her. You can’t think how kindly she said
it all, and how dreadfully sad she looked—I don’t think I could
possibly have said ‘no’ to her. But afterward I began to see
that I couldn’t very well pay the note into your account at the
post-office, for I hadn’t got your little book that you always
take, and besides I didn’t know which office you went to. So
I worried about it all the next day, which was Sunday, and in
the evening at church it suddenly came into my head that I
would put it with your other money inside your waistcoat
pocket.” Roy made an involuntary movement, Sigrid drew a
little nearer, but Frithiof never stirred. Swanhild continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>“So the next morning, when I went into your bedroom to
wake you up, I slipped the note into your pocket, and then I
thought, just supposing you were to lose it, it seemed so light
and so thin, and I pinned it to the lining to make it quite safe.
You were sleeping very soundly, and were quite hard to wake
up. At first I felt pretty happy about it, and I thought if you
asked me if I had put it there when you found it out I should
be able to say ‘yes’ and yet to keep Blanche’s secret. But you
never said a word about it, and I was sure something had
troubled you very much, and I was afraid it must be that, yet
dared not speak about it and I tried to find out from Sigrid,
but she only said that you had many troubles which I was too
young to understand. It often made me very unhappy, but
I never quite understood that I had done wrong till the night
you found me reading the paper, and then I thought that I
ought not to have made the promise to Lady Romiaux. This
is the note which Mr. Osmond brought me from her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof took the little crumpled sheet and read it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Swanhild</span>: You are quite free to speak about that
five-pound note, I never ought to have made you promise secrecy,
and indeed, gave the money just by a sudden impulse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>It was a foolish thing to do, as I see now, but I meant it well.
I hope you will all forgive me. Yours affectionately,</p>

<div class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Blanche.</span>”</div>

<p class='c007'>Then Roy and Sigrid read the note together, and Roy
grasped Frithiof’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you ever forgive me?” he said. “Cecil was right, and
I ought to have known that this miserable affair would one day
be explained.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof still looked half-stunned, he could not realize that
the cloud had at last dispersed, he was so taken up with the
thought of the extraordinary explanation of the mystery—of the
childish, silly, little plan that had brought about such strange
results.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Swanhild!” cried Sigrid, “if only you had spoken
sooner how much pain might have been saved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t say that,” said Frithiof, rousing himself, “she has
chosen the right time, depend upon it. I can hardly believe
it at all yet. But, oh! to think of having one’s honor once
more unstained—and this death in life over!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean? What do you mean?” sobbed poor
little Swanhild, utterly perplexed by the way in which her confession
had been received.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell her,” said Sigrid, glancing at Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he told her exactly what had happened in the shop on
that Monday in June.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We kept it from you,” said Frithiof, “because I liked to
feel that there was at any rate one person unharmed by my
disgrace, and because you seemed so young to be troubled with
such things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how can it have happened?” said Swanhild; “who
took the note really from the till?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must have been Darnell,” said Roy. “He was present
when Sardoni got the change, he saw James Horner put away
the note, he must have managed during the time that you two
were alone in the shop to take it out, and no doubt if he had
been searched first the other five-pound note would have been
found on him. What a blackguard the man must be to have
let you suffer for him! I’ll have the truth out of him before
I’m a day older.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! Frithiof, Frithiof! I’m so dreadfully sorry,” sobbed
poor Swanhild. “I thought it would have helped you, and it
has done nothing but harm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frithiof stooped down and silenced her with a kiss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“You see the harm it has done,” he said, “but you don’t see
the good. Come, stop crying, and let us have tea, for your
news has given me an appetite, and I’m sure you are tired and
hungry after all this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But could it ever have entered any one’s head that such an
improbable thing should actually happen?” said Roy, as he
mused over the story. “To think that Sardoni should get
change for his note, and Darnell steal it on the very day that
Swanhild had given you that unlucky contribution to the debt-fund!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is just one of those extraordinary coincidences which do
happen in life,” said Sigrid. “I believe if every one could be
induced to tell all the strange things of the kind that had
happened we should see that they are after all pretty common
things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder if there is a train to Plymouth to-night?” said
Roy. “I shall not rest till I have seen Darnell. For nothing
less than his confession signed and sealed will satisfy James
Horner. Do you happen to have a Bradshaw?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, but we have something better,” said Sigrid, smiling;
“on the next landing there is Owen, one of the Great Western
guards. I know he is at home, for I passed him just now on
the stairs, and he will tell you about the trains.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a thing it is to live in model lodgings!” said Roy,
smiling. “You seem to me to keep all the professions on the
premises. Come, Frithiof, do go and interview this guard and
ask him how soon I can get down to Plymouth and back again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof went out, there was still a strange look of abstraction
in his face. “I scarcely realized before how much he had
felt this,” said Roy. “What a fool I was to be so positive that
my own view of the case was right! Looking at it from my
own point of view I couldn’t realize how humiliating it must
all have been to him—how exasperating to know that you were
in the right yet not to be able to convince any one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It has been like a great weight on him all through the autumn,”
said Sigrid, “and yet I know what he meant when he
told Swanhild, that it had done him good as well as harm.
Don’t you remember how at one time he cared for nothing but
clearing off the debts? Well, now, though he works hard at
that, yet he cares for other people’s troubles too—that is no
longer his one idea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then because she knew that Roy was thinking of the
hope that this change had brought into their lives, and because
her cheeks grew provokingly hot, she talked fast and continuously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>afraid to face her own thoughts, yet all the time conscious
of such happiness as she had not known for many
months.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before long Frithiof returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think you can do it,” he said. “Owen tells me
there is a train from Paddington at 9.50 this evening, but it
isn’t a direct one and you wont get to Plymouth till 9.28 to-morrow
morning. A most unconscionable time, you see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not write to Darnell?” suggested Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, he would get out of it in some mean way. I intend
to pounce on him unexpectedly, and in that way to get at the
truth,” replied Roy. “This train will do very well. I shall
sleep on the way, but I must just go to Regent Street and get
the fellow’s address.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This, however, Frithiof was able to tell him, and they lingered
long over the tea-table, till at length Roy remembered
that it might be as well to see his father and let him know what
had happened before starting for Devonshire. Very reluctantly
he left the little parlor, but he took away with him the grateful
pressure of Sigrid’s hand, the sweet, bright glance of her
blue eyes, and the echo of her last words, spoken softly and
sweetly in her native language.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Farvel! Tak skal De have.</span></i>” (Farewell! Thanks you
shall have.) Why had she spoken to him in Norse? Was it
perhaps because she wished him to feel that he was no foreigner,
but one of themselves? Whatever her reason, it touched him
and pleased him that she had spoken just in that way, and it
was with a very light heart that he made his way to Rowan
Tree House.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lamp was not lighted in the drawing-room, but there
was a blazing fire, and on the hearth-rug sat Cecil with Lance
nestled close to her, listening with all his ears to one of the
hero stories which she always told him on Sunday evenings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has father gone to chapel?” asked Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, some time ago,” replied Cecil. “Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something told her that Roy’s unexpected appearance was
connected with Frithiof, and, accustomed always to fear for
him, her heart almost stood still.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t look so frightened,” said Roy, as the firelight
showed him her dilated eyes. “Nothing is the matter—I
have brought home some very good news. Frithiof is
cleared, and that wretched business of the five-pound note
fully explained.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“At last!” she exclaimed. “What a relief! But how? Do
tell me all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He repeated Swanhild’s story, and then, hoping to catch his
father in the vestry before the service began, he hurried off,
leaving Cecil to the only companionship she could have borne
in her great happiness—that of little Lance.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Roy found himself too late to catch his father, there was
nothing for it but to wait, and, anxious to speak to him at the
earliest opportunity, he made his way into the chapel that
he might get hold of him when the service was over, for otherwise
there was no saying how long he might not linger talking
with the other deacons, who invariably wanted to ask his advice
about a hundred and one things.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was at this moment giving out the hymn, and Roy liked
to hear him do this once more; it carried him back to his boyhood—to
the times when there had been no difference of opinion
between them. He sighed just a little, for there is a sadness
in all division because it reminds us that we are still in the
days of school-time, that life is as yet imperfect, and that by
different ways, not as we should wish all in the same way, we
are being trained and fitted for a perfect unity elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Boniface was one of those men who are everywhere the
same; he carried his own atmosphere about with him, and sitting
now in the deacon’s seat beneath the pulpit he looked precisely
as he did in his home or in his shop. It was the same
quiet dignity, that was noticeable in him, the same kindly
spirit, the same delightful freedom from all self-importance.
One could hardly look at him without remembering the fine
old saying, “A Christian is God Almighty’s gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When, by and by, he listened to Roy’s story, told graphically
enough as they walked home together, his regret for
having misjudged Frithiof was unbounded. He was almost
as impatient to get hold of Darnell as his son was.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Still,” he observed, “you will not gain much by going to-night,
why not start to-morrow by the first train?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I go now,” said Roy, “I shall be home quite early
to-morrow evening, and Tuesday is Christmas eve—a wretched
day for traveling. Besides, I can’t wait.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both father and mother knew well enough that it was the
thought of Sigrid that had lent him wings, and Mr. Boniface
said no more, only stipulating that he should be just and generous
to the offender.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t visit your own annoyance on him, and don’t speak
too hotly,” he said. “Promise him that he shall not be prosecuted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>or robbed of his character if only he will make full confession,
and see what it was that led him to do such a thing,
I can’t at all understand it. He always seemed to me a most
steady, respectable man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy being young and having suffered severely himself
through Darnell’s wrong-doing, felt anything but judicial as he
traveled westward on that cold December night; he vowed
that horsewhipping would be too good for such a scoundrel,
and rehearsed interviews in which his attack was brilliant
and Darnell’s defense most feeble. Then he dozed a little,
dreamed of Sigrid, woke cold and depressed to find that he
must change carriages at Bristol, and finally after many vicissitudes
was landed at Plymouth at half-past nine on a damp
and cheerless winter morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that he was actually there he began to dislike the
thought of the work before him, and to doubt whether after all
his attack would be as brilliant in reality as in imagination.
Rather dismally he made a hasty breakfast and then set off
through the wet, dingy streets to the shop where Darnell was
at present employed. To his relief he found that it was not a
very large one, and, on entering, discovered the man he sought,
behind the counter and quite alone. As he approached him
he watched his face keenly; Darnell was a rather good-looking
man, dark, pale, eminently respectable; he looked up
civilly at the supposed customer,—then, catching sight of Roy,
he turned a shade paler and gave an involuntary start of surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Robert!” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Darnell; I see you know what I have come for,” said
Roy quietly. “It was certainly a very strange, a most extraordinary
coincidence that Mr. Falck should, unknown to himself,
have had another five-pound note in his pocket that day last
June, but it has been fully explained. Now I want your
explanation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir!” gasped Darnell; “I don’t understand you; I—I
am at a loss—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, don’t tell any more lies about it,” said Roy impatiently.
“We knew now that you must have taken it, for no
one else was present. Only confess the truth and you shall
not be prosecuted; you shall not lose your situation here.
What induced you to do it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t be hard on me, sir,” stammered the man. “I assure
you I’ve bitterly regretted it many a time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then why did you not make a clean breast of it to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>father?” said Roy. “You might have known that he would
never be hard on you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I had,” said Darnell, in great distress; “I wish to
God I had, sir, for it’s been a miserable business from first to
last. But I was in debt, and there was nothing but ruin before
me, and I thought of my wife who was ill, and I knew that the
disgrace would kill her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So you went and disgraced yourself still more,” said Roy
hotly. “You tried to ruin another man instead of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he wasn’t turned off,” said Darnell. “And they put
it all on his illness, and it seemed as if, after all, it would not
hurt him so much. It was a great temptation, and when I had
once given way to it there seemed no turning back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me just how you took it,” said Roy, getting rather
more calm and judicial in his manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I saw Mr. Horner give Signor Sardoni the change, sir, and
I saw him put the note in the till; and I was just desperate
with being in debt and not knowing how to get straight again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But wait a minute—how had you got into such difficulties?”
interrupted Roy. “And how could a five-pound note
help you out again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, sir, I had been unlucky in a betting transaction, but
I thought I could right myself if only I could get something to
try again with; but there wasn’t a soul I could borrow from.
I thought I should get straight again at once if only I had five
pounds in hand, and so I did, sir; I was on my feet again the
very next day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I might have known it was betting that had ruined you,”
said Roy. “Now go back and tell me when you took the note.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I kept on thinking and planning through the afternoon, sir,
and then, presently, all was quiet, and only Mr. Falck with me
in the shop, and I was just wondering how to get rid of him,
when Mr. Horner opened the door of Mr. Boniface’s room and
called to me. Then I said, ‘Do go, Mr. Falck, for I have an
order to write to catch the post.’ And he went for me, and I
hurried across to his counter while he was gone, and took the
note out of his till and put it inside my boot; and when he
came back he found me writing at my desk just as he had left
me. He came up looking a little put out, as if Mr. Horner
had rubbed him the wrong way, and he says to me, ‘It’s no
use; you must go yourself, after all.’ So I went to Mr. Horner,
leaving Mr. Falck alone in the shop.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Were you not afraid lest he should open the till and find
out that the note was gone?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Yes, I was very much afraid. But all went well, and I
intended to go out quickly at tea-time—it was close upon it
then—and do what I could to get it straight again. I thought
I could invent an excuse for not returning to the shop that
night; say I’d been taken suddenly ill or something of that
sort. It was Mr. Falck’s turn to go first; and while he was
out, as ill-luck would have it, Mr. Horner came to take change
from the till, and then all the row began. I made sure I was
ruined, and no one was more surprised than myself at the turn
that affairs took.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” exclaimed Roy, “when you were once more out of
debt, how was it that you did not confess, and do what you
could to make up for your shameful conduct?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, sir, I hadn’t the courage. Sometimes I thought I
would; and then, again, I couldn’t make up my mind to; and
I got to hate Mr. Falck, and I hated him more because he behaved
well about it; and I got into the way of spiting him and
making the place disagreeable to him; and I hoped that he
would leave. But he stuck to his post through it all; and I
began to think that it would be safer that I should leave, for I
felt afraid of him somehow. So at Michaelmas I took this situation.
And oh! sir, for my wife’s sake don’t ruin me; don’t
expose all this to my employer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I promised you just now that you should not be exposed;
but you must write a few words of confession to my father;
and be quick about it, for I want to catch the express to
London.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Darnell, who was still pale and agitated, seized pen and
paper, and wrote a few words of apology and a clear confession.
To write was hard, but he was in such terror lest his employers
should return and discover his miserable secret that he dared
not hesitate—dared not beat about the bush.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roy watched him with some curiosity, wondering now that
he had not suspected the man sooner. But, as a matter of
fact, Darnell had been perfectly self-possessed until his guilt
was discovered; it was the exposure that filled him with shame
and confusion, not the actual dishonesty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know how to thank you enough, sir, for your
leniency,” he said, when he had written, in as few words as
possible, the statement of the facts.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, just let the affair be a lesson to you,” said Roy.
“There’s a great deal said about drunkenness being the
national sin, but I believe it is betting that is at the root of
half the evils of the day. Fortunately, things are now set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>straight as far as may be, yet remember that you have wronged
and perhaps irrevocably injured a perfectly innocent man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I bitterly regret it, sir; I do, indeed,” said Darnell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you do,” said Roy; “I am sure you ought to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And while Darnell still reiterated thanks, and apologies, and
abject regrets, Roy stalked out of the shop and made his way
back to the station.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To think that I believed in that cur, and doubted Falck!”
he said to himself with disgust. “And yet, could any one
have seemed more respectable than Darnell? more thoroughly
trustworthy? And how could I disbelieve the evidence that
was so dead against Frithiof? Sigrid and Cecil trusted him,
and I ought to have done so too, I suppose; but women seem
to me to have a faculty for that sort of thing which we are
quite without.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, after a time, he remembered that the last barrier that
parted him from Sigrid was broken down; and it was just as
well that he had the railway carriage to himself, for he began
to sing so jubilantly that the people in the next compartment
took him for a school-boy returning for his Christmas holidays.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been arranged that if he could catch the express from
Plymouth he should meet his father at the shop, and arriving
at Paddington at half-past six he sprang into a hansom and
drove as quickly as possible to Regent Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof just glanced at him inquiringly as he passed through
the shop, then, reassured by the expression of his face, turned
once more to the fidgety and impatient singing-master who,
for the last quarter of an hour, had been keeping him hard at
work in hunting up every conceivable song that was difficult to
find, and which, when found, was sure to prove unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wondered much what had passed at Plymouth, and when
at last he had got rid of his customer, Roy returned to the shop
with such evident excitement and triumph in his manner that
old Foster thought he must be taking leave of his senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father wants to speak to you, Frithiof,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Frithiof followed him into the little inner room which
had been the scene of such disagreeable interviews in the past.
A strange, dreamlike feeling came over him as he recalled the
wretched summer day when the detective had searched him,
and in horrible, bewildered misery he had seen the five-pound
note, lying on that same leather-covered table, an inexplicable
mystery and a damning evidence against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But visions of the past faded as Mr. Boniface grasped his
hand. “How can I ever apologize enough to you, Frithiof!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>he said. “Roy has brought back a full confession from Darnell,
and the mystery is entirely cleared up. You must forgive
me for the explanation of the affair that I was content with last
summer—I can’t tell you how I regret all that you have had to
suffer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is Darnell’s letter,” said Roy, handing it to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Frithiof read it eagerly, and asked the details of his
friend’s visit to Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will this satisfy Mr. Horner, do you think?” he said, when
Roy had told him all about his interview with Darnell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It cannot fail to convince every one,” said Mr. Boniface.
“It is proof positive that you are free from all blame and that
we owe you every possible apology and reparation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think that Mr. Horner will be content, and will really
sign the fresh deed of partnership?” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He will be forced to see that your honor is entirely vindicated,”
said Mr. Boniface. “But I shall not renew the offer of
partnership to him. He has behaved very ill to you, he has
been insolent to me, and I am glad that, as far as business goes,
our connection is at an end. All that is quite settled. And
now we have a proposal to make to you. We want you, if
nothing better has turned up, to accept a junior partnership in
our firm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof was so staggered by the unexpectedness of this offer
that for a moment or two he could not say a word.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very good,” he said at length. “Far, far too
good and kind to me. But how can I let you do so much for
me—how can I let you take as partner a man who has no
capital to bring into the business?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear boy, money is not the only thing wanted in business,”
said Mr. Boniface, laying his hand on Frithiof’s shoulder.
“If you bring no capital with you bring good abilities,
a great capacity for hard work, and a high sense of honor;
and you will bring too, what I value very much—a keen sympathy
with those employed by you, and a real knowledge of their
position and its difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I dare not refuse your offer,” said Frithiof. “I can’t do
anything but gratefully accept it, but I have done nothing to
deserve such kindness from you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be a comfort to me,” said Mr. Boniface, “to feel
that Roy has some one with whom he can work comfortably.
I am growing old, and shall not be sorry to do a little less, and
to put some of my burden on to younger shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, after entering a little more into detail as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>proposed plan, the three parted, and Frithiof hurried home
eager to tell Sigrid and Swanhild of the great change that had
some over their affairs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Cheerfulness reigned once more in the model lodgings.
As Frithiof opened the door of the parlor he heard such talking
and laughter as there had not been for some time past,
despite Sigrid’s laudable endeavors. Swanhild came dancing
to meet him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look! look!” she cried, “we have got the very dearest
little Christmas tree that ever was seen. And Madame Lechertier
has promised to come to tea to-morrow afternoon, and we
are going out presently to buy the candles for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unheard-of extravagance,” he said, looking at the little fir
tree upon which Sigrid was fastening the candle-holders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only a shilling,” she said apologetically. “And this year
we really couldn’t do without one. But you have brought some
good news—I can see it in your face. Oh, tell me, Frithiof—tell
me quickly just what happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Darnell has made a full confession for one thing,”
he replied. “So the last vestige of the cloud has disappeared.
You can’t think how nice the other men were when they heard
about it. Old Foster gave me such a hand-shake that my arm
aches still.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Mr. Boniface?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can fancy just what he would be as far as kindness
and all that goes. But you will never guess what he has done.
How would you like to count our savings toward the debt-fund
by hundreds instead of by units?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean that he has offered me the junior partnership,” said
Frithiof, watching her face with keen delight, and rewarded
for all he had been through by her rapture of happiness and
her glad surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Swanhild, in the reaction after the long strain of
secret anxiety which had tried her so much all the autumn, she
was like a wild thing; she laughed and sang, danced and chattered,
and would certainly never have eaten any supper had she
not set her heart on going out to buy Christmas presents at a
certain shop in Buckingham Palace Road, which she was sure
would still be open.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“For it is just the sort of shop for people like us,” she
explained, “people who are busy all day and can only do their
shopping in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So presently they locked up the rooms and all three went out
together on the merriest shopping expedition that ever was
known. There was a feeling of Yule-tide in the very air, and
the contentment and relief in their own hearts seemed to be
reflected on every one with whom they came in contact. The
shops seemed more enticing than usual, the presents more fascinating,
the servers more obliging and ready to enter into the
spirit of the thing. Swanhild, with five shillings of her own
earning to lay out on Christmas gifts, was in the seventh heaven
of happiness; Sigrid, with her own secret now once more a joy
and not a care, moved like one in a happy dream; while
Frithiof, free from the miserable cloud of suspicion, freed,
moreover, by all that he had lived through from the hopelessness
of the struggle, was the most perfectly happy of all.
Sometimes he forced himself to remember that it was through
these very streets that he had wandered in utter misery when
he first came to London; and recollecting from what depths
Sigrid had saved him, he thought of her with a new and strange
reverence—there was nothing he would not have done for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>His reflections were interrupted by Swanhild’s voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will have every one from Rowan Tree House, wont
we?” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Herr Sivertsen,” added Sigrid. “He must certainly
come, because he is all alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And whatever happens, we must have old Miss Charlotte,”
said Frithiof; “but it strikes me we shall have to ask people
to bring their own mugs, like children at a school-treat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Sigrid scouted this suggestion, and declared that the blue
and white china would just go round, while, as to chairs, they
could borrow two or three from the neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the return home, and the dressing of the tree,
amid much fun and laughter, and the writing of the invitations,
which must be posted that night. In all London there could
not have been found a merrier household. All the past cares
were forgotten; even the sorrows which could not be healed
had lost their sting, and the Christmas promised to be indeed
full of peace and goodwill.</p>

<p class='c000'>How ten people—to say nothing of Lance and Gwen—managed
to stow themselves away in the little parlor was a mystery
to Frithiof. But Sigrid was a person of resources, and while
he was out the next day she made all sorts of cunning arrangements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>decorated the room with ivy and holly, and so disposed
the furniture that there was a place for every one.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half-past four the guests began to arrive. First Mrs.
Boniface and Cecil with the children, who helped to light the
tree; then Madame Lechertier, laden with boxes of the most
delicious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonbons</span></i> for every one of the party, and soon after there
came an abrupt knock, which they felt sure could only have
been given by Herr Sivertsen. Swanhild ran to open the door
and to take his hat and coat from him. Her eager welcome
seemed to please the old man, for his great massive forehead
was unusually free from wrinkles as he entered and shook
hands with Sigrid, and he bowed and smiled quite graciously as
she introduced him to the other guests. Then he walked round
the Christmas tree with an air of satisfaction, and even stooped
forward and smelled it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So,” he said contentedly, “you keep up the old customs, I
see! I’m glad of it—I’m glad of it. It’s years since I saw a
properly dressed tree. And the smell of it! Great heavens!
it makes me feel like a boy again! I’m glad you don’t follow
with the multitude, but keep to the good old Yule ceremonies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time Cecil was pouring out tea and coffee in
the kitchen, where, for greater convenience, the table had
been placed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid has allowed me to be lady-help and not visitor,” she
said laughingly to Frithiof. “I told her she must be in the
other room to talk to every one after the English fashion, for
you and Swanhild will be too busy fetching and carrying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad to have a chance of saying one word alone to
you,” said Frithiof. “Are you sure that Mrs. Boniface does
not object to this new plan as to the partnership?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, she is delighted about it,” said Cecil. “And she
will tell you so when she has you to herself. I am so glad—so
very glad that your trouble is over at last, and everything
cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can hardly believe it yet,” said Frithiof. “I’m afraid of
waking and finding that all this is a dream. Yet it feels real
while I talk to you, for you were the only outsider who believed
in me and cheered me up last summer. I shall never forget
your trust in me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her eyes sank beneath his frank look of gratitude. She was
horribly afraid lest she should betray herself, and to hide the
burning color which surged up into her face, she turned away
and busied herself with the teapot, which did not at all want
refilling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>“You have forgotten Signor Donati,” she said, recovering
her self-possession.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! I must write to him,” said Frithiof. “I more and
more wonder how he could possibly have had such insight
into the truth. Here come Mr. Boniface and Roy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He returned to the parlor, while Cecil from the background
watched the greetings with some curiosity. In honor of Herr
Sivertsen, and to please Frithiof, both Sigrid and Swanhild
wore their Hardanger peasant dress, and Cecil thought she had
never seen Sigrid look prettier than now, as she shook hands
with Roy, welcoming him with all the charm of manner, with
all the vivacity which was characteristic of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tea for Mr. Boniface, and coffee for Roy,” announced
Swanhild, dancing in. “Lance, you can hand the crumpets,
and mind you don’t drop them all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She pioneered him safely through the little crowd, and Frithiof
returned to Cecil. They had a comfortable little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>
over the tea-table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I dare to think now,” he said, “of the actual amount of the
debts, for at last there is a certainty that in time I can pay
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How glad I am!” said Cecil. “It will be a great relief to
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it will be like getting rid of a haunting demon,” said
Frithiof. “And to see a real prospect of being free once more
is enough to make this the happiest Christmas I have ever
known—to say nothing of getting rid of the other cloud. I
sometimes wonder what would have become of me if I had
never met you and your brother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you had never sheltered us from the rain in your house,”
she said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is in some ways dreadful to see how much depends on
quite a small thing,” said Frithiof thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>And perhaps, could he have seen into Cecil’s heart, he would
have been more than ever impressed with this idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before long they rejoined the rest of the party, and then, all
standing round the tree, they sang <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Glädelig Jul</span></i>, and an English
carol, after which the presents were distributed, amid
much laughter and quite a babel of talk. The whole entertainment
had been given for a few shillings, but it was probably
one of the most successful parties of the season, for all
seemed full of real enjoyment, and all were ready to echo
Lance’s outspoken verdict, that Christmas trees in model lodgings
were much nicer than anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>“But it isn’t fair that the model lodgings should have both
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day,” said Mrs. Boniface, “so
you will come down to Rowan Tree House this evening, and
stay with us for a few days, will you not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no resisting the general entreaty, and indeed, now
that all was cleared up, Frithiof looked forward very much to
staying once more in the household which had grown so home-like
to him. It was arranged that they should go down to
Brixton later in the evening; and when their guests had left,
Sigrid began, a little sadly, to make the necessary preparations.
She was eager to go, and yet something told her that never
again under the same circumstances, would the little household
be under her care.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will take in the tree to the Hallifields,” she said; “the
children will be pleased with it. And, Frithiof, don’t you
think that before we leave you had better just call and thank
Mr. Osmond for his help, and for having been so kind to
Swanhild? He will like to know that all is cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof agreed and set off for Guilford Square. The night
was frosty, and the stars shone out bright and clear. He
walked briskly through the streets, not exactly liking the prospect
of his interview with the clergyman, yet anxious to get it
over, and really grateful for what had been done by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Osmond received him so kindly that his prejudices
vanished at once, and he told him just how the five-pound
note had affected his life, and how all had been satisfactorily
explained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such coincidences are very strange,” said Charles Osmond,
“but it is not the first time that I have come across something
of the sort. Indeed, I know of a case very similar to yours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If Lady Romiaux is still with you,” said Frithiof, flushing
a little, “perhaps you will tell her that all is set straight, and
thank her for having released Swanhild from her promise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is still here,” said Charles Osmond, “and I will certainly
tell her. I think when she gave the money to your sister
she yielded to a kind impulse, not at all realizing how foolish
and useless such a plan was. After all, though she has lived
through so much, she is still in some ways a mere child.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at the Norwegian, wondering what lay beneath
that handsome face, with its Grecian outline and northern
coloring.</p>

<p class='c000'>As if in answer to the thought, Frithiof raised his frank blue
eyes, and met the searching gaze of his companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will not Lord Romiaux remember her youth?” he said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“Do you not think there is at least a hope that he will forgive
her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Charles Osmond felt a strange gladness at his heart,
and over his face there came a look of indescribable content,
for the words revealed to him the noble nature of the man before
him; he knew that not one in a thousand would have so
spoken under the circumstances. The interest he had felt in
this man, whose story had accidentally become known to him,
changed to actual love.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not without a strong hope that those two may be
atoned,” he replied. “But as yet I do not know enough of
Lord Romiaux to feel sure. It would probably involve the
sacrifice of his public life. I do not know whether his love
is equal to such a sacrifice, or whether he has strength and
courage enough to offend the world, or whether he in the least
understands the law of forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you could only get to know him,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I quite hope to do so, and that before long,” said Charles
Osmond. “I think I can get at him through a mutual friend—the
member for Greyshot—but we must not be in too great a
hurry. Depend upon it, the right time will come if we are
only ready and waiting. Do you know the old Scotch proverb,
‘Where twa are seeking they’re sure to find?’ There is a deep
truth beneath those words, a whole parable, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I must not keep you,” said Frithiof, rising. “But I
couldn’t rest till I had thanked you for your help, and let you
know what had happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The affair has made us something more than mere acquaintances,”
said Charles Osmond. “I hope we may learn
to know each other well in the future. A happy Christmas
to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had opened the study door, they were in the passage
outside, and he grasped the Norwegian’s hand. At that moment
it happened that Blanche passed from the dining-room
to the staircase; she just glanced round to see who Charles
Osmond was addressing so heartily, and, perceiving Frithiof,
colored painfully and caught at the banisters for support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having realized what was the Norseman’s character, Charles
Osmond did not regret the meeting; he stood by in silence,
glancing first at his companion’s startled face, then at Blanche’s
attitude of downcast confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Frithiof, in that moment he realized that his early
passion was indeed dead. Its fierce fire had utterly burned
out; the weary pain was over, the terrible battle which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>fought so long was at an end, all that was now left was a chivalrous
regard for the woman who had made him suffer so fearfully,
a selfless desire for her future safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>He strode toward her with outstretched hand. It was the first
time he had actually touched her since they had parted long
ago on the steamer at Balholm, but he did not think of that;
the past which had lingered with him so long and with such
cruel clearness seemed now to have withered like the raiment
of a Viking whose buried ship is suddenly exposed to the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have just been telling Mr. Osmond,” he said, “that,
thanks to your note to Swanhild, a curious mystery has been
explained; he will tell you the details.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you forgive me?” faltered Blanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, with all my heart,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment her sorrowful eyes looked into his; she knew
then that he had entirely freed himself from his old devotion to
her, for they met her gaze frankly, fearlessly, and in their blue
depths there was nothing but kindly forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” she said, once more taking his hand. “Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-by,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned away and went upstairs without another word.
And thus, on this Christmas eve, the two whose lives had been
so strangely woven together parted, never to meet again till
the clearer light of some other world had revealed to them the
full meaning of their early love.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For a time Frithiof was rather silent and quiet, but Sigrid
and Swanhild were in high spirits as they went down to Rowan
Tree House, arriving just in time for supper. The atmosphere
of happiness, however, is always infectious, and he soon threw
off his taciturnity, and dragging himself away from his own engrossing
thoughts, forgot the shadows of life in the pure brightness
of this home which had been so much to him ever since he
first set foot in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Swanhild for an excuse they played all sorts of games;
but when at last she had been sent off to bed, the fun and
laughter quieted down, Mr. and Mrs. Boniface played their
nightly game of backgammon; Roy and Sigrid had a long <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>
in the little inner drawing-room; Cecil sat down at the piano
and began to play Mendelssohn’s Christmas pieces; and Frithiof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>threw himself back in the great arm-chair close by her, listening
half dreamily and with a restful sense of pause in his
life that he had never before known. He desired nothing, he
reveled in the sense of freedom from the love which for so long
had been a misery to him; the very calm was bliss.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is beautiful,” he said, when the music ceased. “After
all there is no one like Mendelssohn, he is so human.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You look like one of the lotos-eaters,” said Cecil, glancing
at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is precisely what I feel like,” he said, with a smile.
“Perhaps it is because you have been giving me</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Music that gentlier on the spirit lies</div>
      <div class='line'>Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I remember so well how you read that to me after I had
been ill.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She took a thin little red volume from the bookshelves beside
her and turned over the leaves. He bent forward to look over
her, and together they read the first part of the poem.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is Norway,” he said. “What could better describe it?”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A land of streams! Some like a downward smoke,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Slow dripping veils of thinnest lawn did go;</div>
      <div class='line'>And some through wavering lights and shadows broke,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... Far off, three mountain-tops,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood sunset-flushed; and, dewed with showery drops,</div>
      <div class='line'>Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“You will not be a true lotos-eater till you are there once
more,” said Cecil, glancing at him. For his dreamy content
was gone, and a wistfulness which she quite understood had
taken its place. “Don’t you think now that all is so different,
you might perhaps go there next summer?” she added.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he replied, “you must not tempt me. I will not go
back till I am a free man and can look every one in the face.
The prospect of being free so much sooner than I had expected
ought to be enough to satisfy me. Suppose we build castles in
the air; that is surely the right thing to do on Christmas eve.
When at last these debts are cleared, let us all go to Norway
together. I know Mr. Boniface would be enchanted with it,
and you, you did not see nearly all that you should have seen.
You must see the Romsdal and the Geiranger, and we must
show you Oldören, where we so often spent the summer holiday.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“How delightful it would be!” said Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t say ‘would,’ say ‘will,’” he replied. “I shall not
thoroughly enjoy it unless we all go together, a huge party.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we should be rather in the way,” she said. “You
would have so many old friends out there, and would want to
get rid of us. Don’t you remember the old lady who was so
outspoken at Balholm when we tried to be friendly and not to
let her feel lonely and out of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof laughed at the recollection.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he said; “she liked to be alone, and preferred to
walk on quickly and keep ‘out of the ruck,’ as she expressed
it. We were ‘the ruck,’ And how we laughed at her opinion
of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, of course you wouldn’t exactly put it in that way, but
all the same, I think you would want to be alone when you go
back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; you are quite mistaken. Now, promise that if Mr.
Boniface agrees, you will all come too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” she said, smiling, “I promise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are they going to?” he exclaimed, glancing into the
inner room where Roy was wrapping a thick sofa blanket about
Sigrid’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Out into the garden to hear the bells, I dare say,” she
replied. “We generally go out if it is fine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us come too,” he said; and they left the bright room
and went out into the dusky veranda, pacing silently to and
fro, absorbed in their own thoughts while the Christmas bells
rang</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Peace and goodwill, goodwill and peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Peace and goodwill to all mankind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the other two, down in a sheltered path at the end of the
garden, were not silent, nor did they listen very much to the
bells.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sigrid,” said Roy, “have you forgotten that you made me
a promise last June?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she said, her voice trembling a little, “I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You promised that when Frithiof was cleared I might ask
you for your answer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She raised her face to his in the dim starlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I did promise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the answer is—?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I love you.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>The soft Norse words were spoken hardly above her breath,
yet Roy knew that they would ring in his heart all his life
long.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My darling!” he said, taking her in his arms. “Oh, if
you knew what the waiting has been to me! But it was my
own fault—all my own fault. I ought to have trusted your
instinct before my own reason.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” she said, clinging to him; “I think I was hard
and bitter that day; you must forgive me, for I was so very
unhappy. Don’t let us speak of it any more. I hate to think
of it even.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And nothing can ever come between us again,” he said, still
keeping his arm round her as they walked on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; never again,” she repeated; “never again. I know
I am too proud and independent, and I suppose it is to crush
down my pride that I have to come to you like this, robbed of
position and money, and—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can you speak of such things,” he said reproachfully.
“You know they are nothing to me—you know that I can never
feel worthy of you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such things do seem very little when one really loves,” she
said gently. “I have thought it over, and it seems to me like
this—the proof of your love to me is that you take me poor, an
exile more or less burdened with the past; the proof of my
love to you is that I kill my pride—and yield. It would have
seemed impossible to me once; but now—Oh, Roy! how I
love you—how I love you!”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>“And about Frithiof?” said Roy presently. “You will
explain all to him, and make him understand that I would not
for the world break up his home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” she replied, “I will tell him; but I think not to-night.
Just till to-morrow let it be only for ourselves. Hark! the
clocks are striking twelve! Let us go in and wish the others
a happy Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Roy kept the first of the good wishes for himself; then,
at length releasing her, walked beside her toward the house,
happy beyond all power of expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now once more outer things began to appeal to him
he became conscious of the Christmas bells ringing gayly in
the stillness of the night, of the stars shining down gloriously
through the clear, frosty air, of the cheerful glimpse of home
to be seen through the uncurtained window of the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Cecil and Frithiof had left the veranda and returned to the
piano; they were singing a carol, the German air of which was
well known in Norway. Sigrid did not know the English
words; but she listened to them now intently, and they helped
to reconcile her to the one thorn in her perfect happiness—the
thought that these other two were shut out from the bliss which
she enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quietly she stole into the room and stood watching them as
they sang the quaint old hymn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Good Christian men rejoice,</div>

      <div class='line'>Christ was born for this.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Cecil, glancing up at her when the carol was ended, read her
secret in her happy, glowing face. She rose from the piano.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A happy Christmas to you,” she said, kissing her on both
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have been out in the garden, right down in the lower
path, and you can’t think how lovely the bells sound,” said
Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with a fresh stab of pain at her heart, she thought of
Frithiof’s spoiled life; she looked wistfully across at him, conscious
that her love for Roy had only deepened her love for
those belonging to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was he never to know anything more satisfying than the
peace of being freed from the heavy load of suspicion? Was
he only to know the pain of love? All her first desire to keep
her secret to herself died away as she looked at him, and in
another minute her hand was on his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear old boy,” she said to him in Norse, “wont you come
out into the garden with me for a few minutes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>So they went out together into the starlight, and wandered
down to the sheltered path where she and Roy had paced to
and fro so long.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a happy Christmas it has been for us all!” she said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very; and how little we expected it,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think,” she began falteringly, “do you think,
Frithiof, it would make you less happy if I told you of a new
happiness that has come to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Her tone as much as the actual words suddenly enlightened
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whatever makes for your happiness makes for mine,” he
said, trying to read her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure of that?” she said, the tears rushing to her
eyes. “Oh, if I could quite believe you, Frithiof, how happy
I should be!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why should you doubt me?” he asked. “Come, I have
guessed your secret, you are going to tell me that—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That Roy will some day be your brother as well as your
friend,” she said, finishing his sentence for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He caught her hand in his and held it fast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you joy, Sigrid, with all my heart. This puts the
finishing touch to our Christmas happiness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Roy has been making such plans,” said Sigrid, brushing
away her tears; “he says that just over the wall there is a
charming little house back to back, you know, with this one,
and it will just hold us all, for of course he will never allow us
to be separated. He told me that long ago, when he first
asked me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Long ago?” said Frithiof; “why, what do you mean, Sigrid?
I thought it was only to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was only to-night that gave him his answer,” said Sigrid.
“It was when we were at the sea last June that he first spoke to
me, and then—afterward—perhaps I was wrong, but I would
not hear anything more about it till your cloud had passed
away. I knew some day that your name must be cleared, and
I was angry with Roy for not believing in you. I dare say I
was wrong to expect it, but somehow I did expect it, and it
disappointed me so dreadfully. He says himself now that he
ought to have trusted—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a wonder that you didn’t make him hate me forever,”
said Frithiof. “Why did you not tell me about it before?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How could I?” she said. “It would only have made you
more unhappy. It was far better to wait.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what a terrible autumn for you!” exclaimed Frithiof.
“And to think that all this should have sprung from that
wretched five-pound note! Our stories have been curiously
woven together, Sigrid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As she thought of the contrast between the two stories her
tears broke forth afresh; she walked on silently hoping that he
would not notice them, but a drop fell right on to his wrist; he
stopped suddenly, took her face between his hands and looked
full into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“You dear little goose,” he said, “what makes you cry!
Was it because I said our stories had been woven together?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s because I wish they could have been alike,” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it wasn’t to be,” he said quietly. “It is an odd thing
to say to you to-night, when your new life is beginning, but to-night
I also am happy, because now at last my struggle is over—now
at last the fire is burned out. I don’t want anything but
just the peace of being free to the end of my life. Believe me,
I am content.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her throat seemed to have closed up, she could not say a
word just because she felt for him so intensely. She gave him
a little mute caress, and once more they paced along the garden
path. But her whole soul revolted against this notion of content.
She understood it as little as the soldier marching to his
first battle understands the calm indifference of the comrade
who lies in hospital. Surely Frithiof was to have something
better in his life than this miserable parody of love? This passion,
which had been almost all pain, could surely not be the
only glimpse vouchsafed him of the bliss which had transfigured
the whole world for her? There came back to her the thought
of the old study at Bergen, and she seemed to hear her father’s
voice saying—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should like an early marriage for Frithiof, but I will not
say too much about you, Sigrid, for I don’t know how I should
ever spare you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And she sighed as she remembered how his plans had been
crossed and his business ruined, and his heart broken—how
both for him and for Frithiof failure had been decreed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the Christmas bells rang on in this world of strangely mingled
joy and sorrow, and they brought her much the same message
that had been brought to her by the silence on Hjerkinshö—</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a better plan which can’t go wrong,” she said, to
herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I have some news for you,” said Mr. Horner to his wife a
few days after this, as one evening he entered the drawing-room.
The huge gold clock with the little white face pointed to the
hour of eight, the golden pigs still climbed the golden hill, the
golden swineherd still leaned meditatively on his golden staff.
Mrs. Horner, arrayed in peacock-blue satin, glanced from her
husband to the clock and back again to her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>“News?” she said in a distinctly discouraging tone “Is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>that which makes you so late? However, it’s of no consequence
to me if the dinner is spoiled, quite the contrary, I am not particular.
But I beg you wont grumble if the meat is done to
a cinder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind the dinner,” replied Mr. Horner captiously.
“I have other things to think of than overdone joints. That
fool Boniface has taken me at my word, and actually doesn’t
intend to renew the partnership.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” cried his wife, “not now that all this affair is
cleared up, and you have apologized so handsomely to young
Falck?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; it’s perfectly disgraceful,” said James Horner, looking
like an angry turkey-cock as he paced to and fro. “I shook
hands with Falck and told him I was sorry to have misjudged
him, and even owned to Boniface that I had spoken hastily, but
would you believe it, he wont reconsider the matter. He not
only gives me the sack but he takes in my place that scheming
Norwegian.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the fellow has no capital,” cried Mrs. Horner, in great
agitation. “He is as poor as a rook! He hasn’t a single
penny to put into the concern.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Precisely. But Boniface is such a fool that he overlooks
that and does nothing but talk of his great business capacities,
his industry, his good address, and a lot of other rubbish of
that sort. Why without money a fellow is worth nothing—absolutely
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“From the first I detested him,” said Mrs. Horner. “I
knew that the Bonifaces were deceived in him. It’s my belief
that although his character is cleared as to this five-pound note
business, yet he is really a mere adventurer. Depend upon it
he’ll manage to get everything into his own hands, and will be
ousting Roy one of these days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, he’s hardly likely to do that, for it seems the sister
has been keeping her eyes open, and that idiot of a Roy is
going to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To marry Sigrid Falck?” exclaimed Mrs. Horner, starting
to her feet. “Actually to bring into the family a girl who plays
at dancing-classes and parties—a girl who sweeps her own
house and cooks her own dinner!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know that she is any the worse for doing that,”
said James Horner. “It’s not the girl herself that I object to,
for she’s pretty and pleasant enough, but the connection, the
being related by marriage to that odious Falck, who has treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>me so insufferably, who looks down on me and is as stand-offish
as if he were an emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If there is one thing I do detest,” said Mrs. Horner, “it is
pushing people—a sure sign of vulgarity. But it’s partly Loveday’s
fault. If I had had to deal with the Falcks they would
have been taught their proper place, and all this would not
have happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment dinner was announced. The overdone
meat did not improve Mr. Horner’s temper, and when the
servants had left the room he broke out into fresh invectives
against the Bonifaces.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When is the wedding to be?” asked his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some time in February, I believe. They are house-furnishing
already.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Horner gave an ejaculation of annoyance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, the sooner we leave London the better,” she said.
“I’m not going to be mixed up with all this; we’ll avoid any
open breach with the family of course, but for goodness’ sake
do let the house and let us settle down elsewhere. There’s
that house at Croydon I was very partial to, and you could go
up and down easy enough from there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll think of it,” said Mr. Horner reflectively. “And,
by the by, must, I suppose, get them some sort of wedding
present.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By good luck,” said Mrs. Horner, “I won a sofa-cushion
last week in a raffle at the bazaar for the chapel organ fund.
It’s quite good enough for them, I’m sure. I did half think of
sending it to the youngest Miss Smith, who is to be married on
New Year’s Day, but they’re such rich people that I suppose I
must send them something a little more showy and expensive.
This will do very well for Sigrid Falck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Luckily the opinion of outsiders did not at all mar the happiness
of the two lovers. They were charmed to hear that the
Horners were leaving London, and when in due time the sofa-cushion
arrived, surmounted by Mrs. Horner’s card, Sigrid,
who had been in the blessed condition of expecting nothing,
was able to write a charming little note of thanks, which by
its straightforward simplicity, made the donor blush with an
uncomfortable sense of guilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And after all,” remarked Sigrid to Cecil, “we really owe a
great deal to Mrs. Horner, for if she had not asked me to that
children’s fancy ball I should never have met Madame Lechertier,
and how could we ever have lived all together if it had not
been for that?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“In those days I think Mrs. Horner rather liked you, but
somehow you have offended her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why of course it was by earning my living and setting up
in model lodgings; I utterly shocked all her ideas of propriety,
and, when once you do that, good-by to all hopes of remaining
in Mrs. Horner’s good books. It would have grieved me to
displease any of your relations if you yourselves cared for
them, but the Horners—well, I can not pretend to care the
least about them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two girls were in the little sitting-room of the model
lodgings, putting the finishing touches to the white cashmere
wedding-dress which Sigrid had cut out and made for herself
during the quiet days they had spent at Rowan Tree House.
Every one entered most heartily into all the busy preparations,
and Sigrid could not help thinking to herself that the best
proof that trouble had not spoiled or soured the lives either of
Cecil or Frithiof lay in their keen enjoyment of other people’s
happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wedding was to be extremely quiet. Early in the
morning, when Cecil went to see if she could be of any use,
she found the bride-elect in her usual black dress and her
housekeeping apron of brown holland, busily packing Frithiof’s
portmanteau.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, let me do it for you,” she said. “The idea of your
toiling away to-day just as if you were not going to be married!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Must brides sit and do nothing until the ceremony?” she
asked. “If so, I am sorry for them; I couldn’t sit still if I
were to try. How glad I am to think Frithiof and Swanhild
will be at Rowan Tree House while we are away! I should
never have had a moment’s peace if I had left them here,
for Swanhild is, after all, only a child. It is so good of Mrs.
Boniface to have asked them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Since you are taking Roy away from us, I think it is the
least you could do,” said Cecil, laughing. “It will be such a
help to have them this evening, for otherwise we should all be
feeling very flat, I know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And we shall be on our way to the Riviera,” said Sigrid,
pausing for a few minutes in her busy preparations; a dreamy
look came into her clear, practical eyes, and she let her head
rest against the side of the bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sometimes, do you know,” she exclaimed, “I can’t believe
this is all real, I think I am just imagining it all, and that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>shall wake up presently and find myself playing the Myosotis
waltz at the academy—it was always such a good tune to
dream to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait,” said Cecil; “does this make it feel more real,” and
hastily going into the outer room she returned bearing the
lovely wedding bouquet which Roy had sent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lilies of the valley!” exclaimed Sigrid. “Oh, how exquisite!
And myrtle and eucharist lilies—it is the most beautiful
bouquet I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you think it is time you were dressing,” said Cecil.
“Come, sit down and let me do your hair for you while you enjoy
your flowers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But Swanhild’s packing—I don’t think it is quite finished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind, I will come back this afternoon with her and
finish everything; you must let us help you a little just for
once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, as she brushed out the long, golden hair, she
thought how few brides showed Sigrid’s wonderful unselfishness
and care for others, and somehow wished that Roy could
have seen her just as she was, in her working-day apron, too
full of household arrangements to spend much time over her
own toilet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild, already dressed in her white cashmere and pretty
white beaver hat, danced in and out of the room fetching and
carrying, and before long the bride, too, was dressed, and with
her long tulle veil over the dainty little wreath of real orange
blossom from Madame Lechertier’s greenhouse, and the homemade
dress which fitted admirably, she walked into the little
sitting-room to show herself to Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall hold up your train, Sigrid, in case the floor is at all
dusty,” said Swanhild, much enjoying the excitement of the
first wedding in the family, and determined not to think of the
parting till it actually came.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof made an involuntary exclamation as she entered the
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You look like Ingeborg,” he said, “when she came into the
new temple of Balder.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Followed by many a fair attendant maiden,</div>
      <div class='line'>As shines the moon amid surrounding stars,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>quoted Swanhild in Norse from the old saga, looking roguishly
up at her tall brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sigrid laughed and turned to Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She says that I am the moon and shine with a borrowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>light, and that you are the stars with light of your own. By-the-by,
where is my other little bridesmaid?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen is to meet us at the church,” explained Cecil. “Do
you know I think the carriage must be waiting, for I see the
eldest little Hallifield tearing across the court-yard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I must say good-by to every one,” said Sigrid; and
with one last look round the little home which had grown so
dear to them, she took Frithiof’s arm and went out into the
long stone passage, where a group of the neighbors stood
waiting to see the last of her, and to give her their hearty good
wishes. She had a word and a smile for every one, and they
all followed her down the stairs and across the court-yard and
stood waving their hands as the carriage drove off.</p>

<p class='c000'>That chapter of her life was ended, and the busy hive of
workers would no longer count her as queen-bee of the establishment.
The cares and troubles and wearing economies were
things of the past, but she would take with her and keep forever
many happy memories; and many friendships would still
last and give her an excuse for visiting afterward the scene of
her first home in London.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was quite silent as they drove through the busy streets,
her eyes had again that sweet, dreamy look in them that
Cecil had noticed earlier in the morning; she did not seem
to see outward things, until after a while her eyes met Frithiof’s,
and then her face, which had been rather grave, broke into
sudden brightness, and she said a few words to him in Norse,
which he replied to with a look so full of loving pride and
contentment that it carried the sunshine straight into Cecil’s
heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This marriage is a capital thing for him,” she thought to
herself. “He will be happy in her happiness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time they had reached the church; Lance, in the
dress he had worn at Mrs. Horner’s fancy ball, stood ready to
hold the bride’s train, and Gwen came running up to take her
place in the little procession.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few spectators had dropped in, but the church was very
quiet, and up in the chancel there were only Roy and his best
man, Madame Lechertier, old Herr Sivertsen, and the father
and mother of the bridegroom. Charles Osmond read the
service, and his pretty daughter-in-law had begged leave to
play the organ, for she had taken a fancy not only to little
Swanhild, but to the whole family, when at her father-in-law’s
request she had called upon them. After the wedding was
over and the procession had once more passed down the aisle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>she still went on playing, having a love of finishing in her
nature. Charles Osmond came out of the vestry and stood
beside her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad you played for them,” he said when the last
chord had been struck. “It was not at all the sort of wedding
to be without music.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was one of the nicest weddings I was ever at,” she said:
“and as to your Norseman—he is all you said, and more. Do
you know, there is a strong look about him which somehow
made me think of my father. Oh! I do hope he will be able
to pay off the debts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is only one thing which could hinder him,” said
Charles Osmond.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that?” asked Erica, looking up quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Death,” he replied quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>She made no answer, but the word did not jar upon her, for
she was one of those who have learned that death is indeed the
Gate of Life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Silently she pushed in the stops and locked the organ.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One spring evening, rather more than two years after the
wedding, Sigrid was working away in the little back garden, to
which, now that her household duties were light, she devoted
a good deal of her time. It joined the garden of Rowan Tree
House, and, for greater convenience, an opening had been
made in the hedge, and a little green gate put up. Upon this
gate leaned Cecil chatting comfortably, her tennis racquet
under her arm, and with a pleasant consciousness that the
work of the day was over, and that Roy and Frithiof might
soon be expected for the nightly game which, during the season,
they seldom cared to miss.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are late this evening,” said Sigrid. “I wonder
whether Herr Sivertsen has caught Frithiof. I hope not, for
the tennis does him so much good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is he working very hard?” asked Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He always works furiously; and just now I think he has
got what some one called ‘the lust of finishing’ upon him;
we see very little of him, for when he is not at business he is
hard at work over Herr Sivertsen’s manuscript. But it really
seems to agree with him; they say, you know, that work without
worry harms no one.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“A very moral precept,” said a voice behind her, and glancing
up she saw Frithiof himself crossing the little lawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two years had not greatly altered him, but he seemed
more full of life and vigor than before, and success and hope
had entirely banished the look of conflict which for so long
had been plainly visible in his face. Sigrid felt proud of him
as she glanced round; there was something in his mere physical
strength which always appealed to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were just talking about you,” she said, “and wondering
when you would be ready to play.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“After that remark of yours which I overheard I almost think
I shall have to eschew tennis,” he said, laughing. “Why should
I give a whole hour to it when Herr Sivertsen is impatiently
waiting for the next installment?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Herr Sivertsen is insatiable,” said Sigrid, taking off her
gardening-gloves. “And I’m not going to allow you to return
to your old bad ways; as long as you live with me you will
have to be something more than a working drudge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Since Sigrid has begun baby’s education,” said Frithiof,
turning laughingly to Cecil, “we notice that she has become
very dictatorial to the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shouldn’t make stage asides in such a loud voice,”
said Sigrid, pretending to box his ears. “I am going to meet
Roy and to fetch the racquets, and you take him into the garden,
Cecil, and make him behave properly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you really so specially busy just now?” asked Cecil,
as he opened the little gate and joined her; “or was it only
your fun?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, it was grim earnest,” he replied. “For since Herr
Sivertsen has been so infirm I have had most of his work to do.
But it is well-paid work, and a very great help toward the debt
fund. In ten years’ time I may be free.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will really have paid off everything?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I quite hope to be able to do so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be a great work done,” she said thoughtfully.
“But when it is all finished, I wonder whether you will not feel
a little like the men who work all their lives to make a certain
amount and then retire, and can’t think what to do with themselves?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope not,” said Frithiof; “but I own that there is a
chance of it. You see, the actual work in itself is hateful to
me. Never, I should think, was there any one who so loathed
indoor work of all kinds, specially desk work. Yet I have
learned to take real interest in the business, and that will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>remain and still be my duty when the debts are cleared off. It
is a shocking confession, but I own that when Herr Sivertsen’s
work is no longer a necessity it will be an immense relief to me,
and I doubt if I shall ever open that sort of book again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must be terrible drudgery,” said Cecil, “since you can’t
really like it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Herr Sivertsen has given me up as a hopeless case; he has
long ago ceased to talk about Culture with a capital C to it;
he no longer expects me to take any interest in the question
whether earth-worms do or do not show any sensitiveness to
sound when placed on a grand piano. I told him that the bare
idea is enough to make any one in the trade shudder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil laughed merrily. It was by no means the first time
that he had told her of his hopeless lack of all literary and
scientific tastes, and she admired him all the more for it, because
he kept so perseveringly to the work, and disregarded his personal
tastes so manfully. They had, moreover, many points in
common, for there was a vein of poetry in his nature as well as
in hers; like most Norwegians, he was musical, and his love of
sport and of outdoor life had not robbed him of the gentler
tastes—love of scenery and love of home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See!” she exclaimed, “there is the first narcissus. How
early it is! I must take it to mother, for she is so fond of
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stooped to gather the flower for her, and as she took it
from him, he just glanced at her for a moment; she was looking
very pretty that evening, her gray eyes were unusually
bright, there was a soft glow of color in her fair face, an air of
glad contentment seemed to hover about her. He little guessed
that it was happiness in his success which was the cause of all
this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even as he watched her, however, her color faded, her lips
began to quiver, she seemed to be on the point of fainting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is anything the matter?” he asked, alarmed by the sudden
change in her face. “Are you ill, Cecil?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She did not reply, but let him help her to the nearest garden
seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the scent of the narcissus; it is too strong for you,”
he suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she gasped. “But a most awful feeling came over
me. Something is going to happen, I am sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked perplexed. She dropped the narcissus from her
hand, and he picked it up and put it on the farther side of the
bench, still clinging to his own theory that it was the cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>her faintness. Her face, which a moment before had been so
bright, was now white as the flower itself, and the look of suffering
in it touched him.</p>

<p class='c000'>His heart began to beat a little uneasily when he saw a servant
approaching them from the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is right,” he thought to himself. “What on earth can
it be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Master asked me to give you this, Miss Cecil,” said the
maid, handing her a little penciled note.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sat up hastily, making a desperate effort to look as if
nothing were wrong with her. The servant went back to the
house, and Frithiof waited anxiously to hear what the note was
about. She read it through and then handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Grantley has come, and wishes to see the children.
He will not take them away for a few days, but you had better
bring them down to see him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is out of prison!” exclaimed Frithiof. “But surely
his time is not up yet. I thought he had five years?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The five years would be over next October. I knew it
would come some day, but I never thought of it so soon, and to
take them away in a few days!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I remember now,” said Frithiof; “there is a rule that by
good behavior in prison they can slightly shorten their time.
I am so sorry for you; it will be a fearful wrench to you to
part with Lance and Gwen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She locked her hands together, making no attempt at an
answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How exactly like the world,” thought Frithiof to himself.
“Here is a girl passionately devoted to these children, while
the mother, who never deserved them at all, has utterly deserted
them. To have had them for five years and then suddenly
to lose them altogether, that is a fearful blow for her;
they ought to have thought of it before adopting the children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there nothing I can do to help you?” he said, turning
toward her. “Shall I go and fetch Lance and Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>With an effort she stood up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” she said, trying hard to speak cheerfully. “Don’t
let this spoil your game. I am better, I will go and find them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But by a sudden impulse he sprang up, made her take his
arm and walked to the house with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are still rather shaky, I think,” he said. “Let me
come with you, I can at any rate save you the stairs. How
strange it was that you should have known beforehand that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>this was coming! Did you ever have a presentiment of that
kind over anything else?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never,” she said. “It was such an awful feeling. I wonder
what it is that brings it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He left her in the hall and ran upstairs to the nursery, where
he was always a welcome visitor. Both children rushed to meet
him with cries of delight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cecil has sent me up with a message to you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To say we may come down,” shouted Lance. “Is it that,
Herr Frithiof?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” cried Gwen, dancing round him, “it’s to say a holiday
for to-morrow, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, not that exactly,” he said; “but your father has come,
and Cecil wants you to come down and see him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The children’s faces fell. It seemed almost as if they instinctively
knew of the cloud that hung over their father. They
had always known that he would some day come to them; but
his name had been little mentioned. It was difficult to mention
it without running the risk of the terrible questions which
as children they were so likely to ask. All the gladness and
spirit seemed to have left them. They were both shy, and the
meeting with this unknown parent was a terror to them. They
clung to Frithiof as he took them downstairs, and, catching
sight of Cecil leaning back in one of the hall chairs, they made
a rush for her, and poured out all their childish fears as she
clung to them and kissed them with all the tenderness of a real
mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We don’t want to go and see father,” said Lance stoutly.
“We had much rather not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you must think that he wants to see you very much,”
said Cecil. “He remembers you quite well, though you have
forgotten him; and now that he has come back to you, you
must both make him very happy, and love him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t like him at all,” said Gwen perversely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is silly and wrong to say that,” said Cecil. “You will
love him when you see him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I love you,” said Gwen, with a vehement hug.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you only room for one person in your heart?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I rather love Herr Frithiof,” said Gwen, glancing up at him
through her eyelashes.</p>

<p class='c000'>They both smiled, and Cecil, seeing that little would be
gained by discussing the matter, got up and led them toward
the drawing-room, her pale, brave face contrasting curiously
with Gwen’s rosy cheeks and rebellious little air.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Mr. Boniface sat talking to the new-comer kindly enough.
They both rose as Cecil and the children entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is my daughter,” said Mr. Boniface.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Cecil shook hands with the ex-prisoner, and looked a
little anxiously into his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was rather a pleasant-looking man of five-and-thirty, and
so much like Lance that she could not help feeling kindly
toward him. She hoped that the children would behave well,
and glanced at Gwen nervously.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Gwen, who was a born flirt, speedily forgot her dislike,
and was quite willing to meet the stranger’s advances half-way.
In two minutes’ time she was contentedly sitting on his
knee, while Lance stood shyly by, studying his father with a
gravity which was, however, inclined to be friendly and not
critical. When he had quite satisfied himself he went softly
away, returning before long with a toy pistol and a boat, which
he put into his father’s hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is this?” said Mr. Grantley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s my favorite toys,” said Lance. “I wanted to
show them you. Quick, Gwen, run and find your doll for
father.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed touched and pleased; and indeed they were
such well-trained children that any parent must have been
proud of them. To this ex-convict, who for years had been
cut off from all child-life, the mere sight of them was refreshing.
He seemed quite inclined to sit there and play with them
for the rest of the evening. And Cecil sat by in a sort of
dream, hearing of the new home that was to be made for the
children in British Columbia—where land was to be had for
a penny an acre, and where one could live on grapes and
peaches, and all the most delicious fruits. Then, presently,
with many expressions of gratitude for all that had been done
for the children, Mr. Grantley took leave, and she led the little
ones up to bed, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Boniface to go out into
the garden and tell Roy and Sigrid what had passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How does Cecil take it?” asked Sigrid anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very quietly,” was the reply; “but I am afraid she feels
losing them so soon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof, with an uncomfortable recollection of what had
passed in the garden, doubted if Mrs. Boniface fully understood
the depth of Cecil’s feelings. He left them talking over
the drawbacks and advantages of colonial life, and went in to
his translating; but though he forgot the actual cause, he was
conscious all the time of a disturbing influence, and even while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>absorbed in his work, had an irritating sense that something
had gone wrong, and that trouble was in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went to bed and dreamed all night of Cecil. She
haunted him persistently; sometimes he saw her leaning back
on the garden seat, with the narcissus just falling from her hand,
sometimes he saw her with the children clinging to her as they
had done in the hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that time forward a great change came over his attitude
toward her. Hitherto his friendship with her had, it must
be owned, been chiefly selfish. He had always heartily liked
her, had enjoyed being at Rowan Tree House, had fallen into
the habit of discussing many things with her and valuing her
opinion, but it was always of himself he had thought—of what
she could do for him, of what he could learn from her, of how
much enjoyment he could get from her music and her frank
friendliness, and her easy way of talking. It was not that he
was more selfish than most men, but that they had learned
really to know each other at a time when his heart was so paralyzed
by Blanche’s faithlessness, so crushed by the long series
of misfortunes, that giving had been out of the question for him;
he could merely take and make the most of whatever she could
give him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now all this was altered. The old wounds, though to
the end of his life they must leave a scar, were really healed.
He had lived through a great deal, and had lived in a way that
had developed the best points in his character. He had now a
growingly keen appreciation for all that was really beautiful—for
purity, and strength, and tenderness, and for that quality
which it is the fashion to call Altruism, but which he, with his
hatred of affectation in words, called goodness.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he thought of Cecil during those days he began to see
more and more clearly the full force of her character. Hitherto
he had quietly taken her for granted; there was nothing very
striking about her, nothing in the least obtrusive. Perhaps
if it had not been for that strange little scene in the garden he
would never have taken the trouble to think of her actual
character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the week that followed he watched her with keen
interest and sympathy. That she should be in trouble—at any
rate, in trouble that was patent to all the world—was something
entirely new. Their positions seemed to be reversed; and he
found himself spontaneously doing everything he could think
of to please and help her. Her trouble seemed to draw them
together; and to his mind there was something very beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>in her passionate devotion to the children—for it was a devotion
that never in the least bordered on sentimentality. She
went through everything very naturally, having a good cry
now and then, but taking care not to make the children unhappy
at the prospect of the parting, and arranging everything
that they could possibly want, not only on the voyage, but for
some time to come in their new home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is so plucky!” thought Frithiof to himself, with a
thrill of admiration. For he was not at all the sort of man to
admire helplessness, or languor, or cowardice; they seemed to
him as unlovely in a woman as in a man.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the actual parting came. Cecil would have liked to
go down to the steamer and see the children start, but on
thinking it over she decided that it would be better not.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They will feel saying good-by,” she said, “and it had better
be here. Then they will have the long drive with you to
the docks, and by that time they will be all right again, and
will be able to enjoy the steamer and all the novelty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Boniface was obliged to own that there was sound common-sense
in this plan; so in their own nursery, where for
nearly five years she had taken such care of them, Cecil
dressed the two little ones for the last time, brushed out Gwen’s
bright curls, coaxed Lance into his reefer, and then, no longer
able to keep back her tears, clung to them in the last terrible
parting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Cecil, dear, darling Cecil,” sobbed Lance, “I don’t
want to go away; I don’t care for the steamer one bit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was on the hearthrug, with both children nestled close
to her, the thought of the unknown world that they were going
out into, and the difficult future awaiting them, came sweeping
over her; just as they were then, innocent, and unconscious,
and happy, she could never see them again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be good, Lance,” she said, through her tears. “Promise
me always to try to be good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I promise,” said the little fellow, hugging her with all his
might. “And we shall come back as soon as ever we’re grown
up—we shall both come back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” said Cecil, “you must come back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But in her heart she knew that however pleasant the meeting
in future years might be, it could not be like the present; as
children, and as her own special charge, she was parting with
them forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>The carriage drove up to the door; there came sounds of
hurrying feet and fetching and carrying of luggage; Cecil took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>them downstairs, and then, with a last long embrace from
Lance, and kisses interspersed with sobs from Gwen, she gave
them up to her father, and turned to take leave of their nurse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will take great care of them, miss,” said the maid, herself
crying, “and you shall hear from me regularly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In another minute the carriage had driven away, and Cecil
was left to make the best she might of what she could not but
feel, at first, a desolate life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XXXIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Hardly had the bustle of departure quieted down at Rowan
Tree House when a fresh anxiety arose. Herr Sivertsen, who
had for some time been out of health, was seized with a fatal
illness, and for three days and nights Frithiof was unable to
leave him; on the third night the old Norseman passed quietly
away, conscious to the last minute, and with his latest breath
inveighing against the degeneracy of the age.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frithiof is a rare exception,” he said, turning his dim eyes
toward Sigrid, who stood by the bedside. “And to him I
leave all that I have. As for the general run of young men
nowadays—I wash my hands of them—a worthless set—a degenerate—”</p>

<p class='c000'>His voice died away, he sighed deeply, caught Frithiof’s
hand in his, and fell back on the pillow lifeless.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the will was read it affirmed that Herr Sivertsen, who
had no relations living, had indeed left his property to Frithiof.
The will was terse and eccentric in the extreme, and seemed
like one of the old man’s own speeches, ending with the
familiar words, “for he is one of the few honest and hard-working
men in a despicable generation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Naturally there was only one way to which Frithiof could
think of putting his legacy. Every penny of it went straight
to his debt-fund. Mr. Horner heard of it and groaned.
“What!” he exclaimed, “pay away the principal; hand over
thousands of pounds in payment of debts that are not even his
own—debts that don’t affect his name! He ought to put the
money into this business, Boniface; it would only be a fitting
way of showing you his gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He put into the business what I value far more,” said Mr.
Boniface. “He put into it his honest Norwegian heart, and
this legacy will save him many years of hard, weary work and
anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>When summer came it was arranged that they should go to
Norway, and Frithiof went about his work with such an air of
relief and contentment, that had it not been for one hidden
anxiety Sigrid’s happiness would have been complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her marriage had been so extremely happy that she was less
than ever satisfied with the prospect that seemed to lie before
Cecil. The secret which she had found out at the time of
Frithiof’s disgrace weighed upon her now a good deal; she
almost wished that Roy would guess it; but no one else seemed
to have any suspicion of it at all, and Sigrid of course could
not speak, partly because she was Frithiof’s sister, partly because
she had a strong feeling that to allude to that matter
would be to betray Cecil unfairly. Had she been a matchmaker
she might have done endless harm; had she been a
reckless talker she would probably have defeated her own
ends; but happily she was neither, and though at times she
longed to give Frithiof a good shaking, when she saw him entirely
absorbed in his work and blind to all else, she managed
to keep her own counsel, and to await, though somewhat impatiently,
whatever time should bring. One evening it chanced
that the brother and sister were alone for a few minutes during
the intervals of an amateur concert, which Cecil had been
asked to get up at Whitechapel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you think it has gone off?” said Sigrid, as he sat
down beside her in the little inner room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Capitally; Cecil ought to be congratulated,” he replied.
“I am glad she has had it on hand, for it must have taken her
thoughts off the children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Sigrid; “anything that does that is worth something.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet she seems to me to have plenty of interests,” said
Frithiof. “She is never idle; she is a great reader.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think books would ever satisfy a woman like
Cecil?” exclaimed Sigrid, with a touch of scorn in her voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her quickly, struck by something unusual in
her tone, and not at all understanding the little flush of hot
color that had risen in her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” he said teasingly, “you think that every one has your
ideal of happiness, and cannot manage to exist without the
equivalent of Roy and baby, to say nothing of the house and
garden.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think anything of the sort,” she protested, relieved
by his failure to appropriate to himself her rather unguarded
speech.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>“Norway will be the best thing in the world for her,” he
said. “It is the true panacea for all evils. Can you believe
that in less than a week we shall actually be at Bergen once
more!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Sigrid, looking at his eager, blue eyes, and remembering
his brave struggles and long exile, could not find it in her
heart to be angry with him any more. Besides, he had been
very thoughtful for Cecil just lately, and seemed to have set
his heart on making the projected tour in Norway as nearly
perfect as might be. To Sigrid there was a serious drawback—she
was obliged to leave her baby behind in England;
however, after the first wrench of parting, she managed to
enjoy herself very well, and Mrs. Boniface, who was to spend
the six weeks of their absence in Devonshire with some of her
cousins, promised to take every possible care of her little
grandson, to telegraph now and then, and to write at every opportunity.
It had been impossible for Mr. Boniface to leave
London, but the two younger members of the firm, with Sigrid,
Cecil, and little Swanhild, made a very merry party, and
Frithiof, at length free from the load of his father’s debts,
seemed suddenly to grow ten years younger. Indeed, Sigrid,
who for so long had seen her hopes for Cecil defeated by the
cares and toils brought by these same debts, began to fear that
now his extreme happiness in his freedom would quite suffice
to him, and that he would desire nothing further.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly, for many years he had known nothing like the
happiness of that voyage, with its bright expectation, its sense
of relief. To look back on the feverish excitement of his voyage
to England five years before was like looking back into
some other life; and if the world was a graver and sadder
place to him now than it had been long ago, he had at any
rate learned that life was not limited to three-score years and
ten, and had gained a far deeper happiness of which no one
could rob him. On the Wednesday night he slept little, and
very early in the morning was up on the wet and shining deck
eagerly looking at the first glimpse of his own country. His
heart bounded within him when the red roofs and gables of
Stavanger came into sight, and he was the very first to leap
off the steamer, far too impatient to touch Norwegian soil once
more to dream of waiting for the more leisurely members of
the party. The quiet little town seemed still fast asleep; he
scarcely met a soul in the primitive streets with their neat
wooden houses and their delightful look of home. In a rapture
of happiness he walked on drinking down deep breaths of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>fresh morning air, until coming at length to the cathedral he
caught sight of an old woman standing at the door, key in hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stopped and had a long conversation with her for the mere
pleasure of hearing his native tongue once more; he made her
happy with a <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">kroner</span></i> and enjoyed her grateful shake of the
hand, then, partly to please her, entered the cathedral. In the
morning light, the severe beauty of the old Norman nave was
very impressive; he knelt for a minute or two, glad to have the
uninterrupted quiet of the great place before it had been
reached by any of the tourists. It came into his mind how,
long ago, his father’s last words to him had been “A happy
return to Gammle Norge,” how for so long those words had
seemed to him the bitterest mockery—an utter impossibility—and
how, at last in a very strange and different way, they had
come true. He had come back, and, spite of all that had intervened,
he was happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later in the day, when they slowly steamed into Bergen harbor
and saw once more the place that he had so often longed
for, with its dear familiar houses and spires, its lovely surrounding
mountains, his happiness was not without a strong touch
of pain. For after all, though the place remained, his home
had gone forever, and though Herr Grönvold stood waiting for
them on the landing quay with the heartiest of welcomes, yet
he could not but feel a terrible blank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil read his face in a moment, and understood just what
he was feeling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come and let us look for the luggage,” she said to Roy,
wishing to leave the three Norwegians to themselves for a few
minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rather different to our last arrival here,” said Roy brightly.
He was so very happy that it was hardly likely he should think
just then of other people. But as Cecil gave the assent which
seemed so matter-of-fact her eyes filled with tears, for she could
not help thinking of all the brightness of that first visit, of
Frithiof with his boyish gayety and light-heartedness, of the
kindness and hospitality of his father, of the pretty villa in
Kalvedalen, of poor Blanche in her innocent girlhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all to stay for a few days with the Grönvolds, and
there was now plenty of room for them, since Karen and the
eldest son were married and settled in homes of their own. Fru
Grönvold and Sigrid met with the utmost affection, and all the
petty quarrels and vexations of the past were forgotten; indeed,
the very first evening they had a hearty laugh over the recollection
of their difference of opinion about Torvald Lundgren.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>“And, my dear” said Fru Grönvold, who was as usual knitting
an interminable stocking. “You need not feel at all anxious
about him, he is very happily married, and I think, yes,
certainly can not help owning, that he manages his household
with a firmer hand than would perhaps have suited you. He
has a very pretty little wife who worships the ground he
treads on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which you see I could never have done,” said Sigrid merrily.
“Poor Torvald! I am very glad he is happily settled.
Frithiof must go and see him. How do you think Swanhild is
looking, Auntie?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well and very pretty,” said Fru Grönvold. “One
would naturally suppose that, at her rather awkward age, she
would have lost her good looks, but she is as graceful as ever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is a very brave, hard-working little woman,” said
Sigrid. “I told you that she had begged so hard to stay on
with Madame Lechertier that we had consented. It would
indeed have been hardly fair to take her away all at once, when
Madame had been so kind and helpful to us; and Swanhild is
very independent, you know, and declares that she must have
some sort of profession, and that to be a teacher of dancing is
clearly her vocation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By and by, when she is grown up, she is going to keep my
house,” said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” said Sigrid; “I shall never spare her, unless it is
to get married; you two would never get on by yourselves.
By the by, I am sure Cecil is keeping away from us on purpose;
she went off on the plea of reading for her half-hour society, but
she has been gone quite a long time. Go and find her, Frithiof,
and tell her we very much want her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went out and found Cecil comfortably installed in the
dining-room with her book.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you not read enough?” he said. “We are very dull
without you in there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought you would have so much to talk over together,”
she said, putting down her book and lifting her soft gray eyes
to his.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a bit,” he replied; “we are pining for music and want
you to sing, if you are not too tired. What learned book were
you reading, after such a journey? Plato?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A translation of the ‘Phaedo,’” she said. “There is such
a strange little bit here about pleasure being mixed with pain
always.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, they had found that out in those days, had they?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>said Frithiof. “Read the bit to me; for, to tell you the truth,
it would fit in rather well with this return to Bergen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil turned over the pages and read the following speech
of Socrates:</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘How singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously
related to pain, which might be thought to be the opposite
of it; for they never come to man together, and yet he who
pursues either of them is generally compelled to take the other.
They are two, and yet they grow together out of one head or
stem; and I cannot help thinking that if Æsop had noticed
them he would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile
their strife, and when he could not, he fastened their heads
together; and this is the reason why, when one comes the
other follows.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s odd to think that all these hundreds of years people
have been racking their brains to find some explanation of
the great problem,” said Frithiof, “that generation after generation
of unsatisfied people have lived and died.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A poor woman from East London once answered the problem
to me quite unconsciously,” said Cecil. “She was down
in the country for change of air, and she said to me, ‘It’s just
like Paradise here, miss, and if it could always go on it would
be heaven.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come and sing me ‘Princessen,’” he said, “if you are
really not too tired. I am very much in the mood of that restless
lady in the poem.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And, in truth, often during those days at Bergen he was
haunted by the weird ending of the song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘What <em>do</em> I then want, my God?’ she cried</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the sun went down.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He had a good deal of business to see to, and the clearing off
of the debts was, of course, not without a considerable pleasure;
he greatly enjoyed, too, the hearty welcome of his old
friends; but there was always something wanting. For every
street, every view, every inch of the place was associated with
his father, and, dearly as he loved Bergen, he felt that he could
not have borne to live in it again. He seemed to find his chief
happiness in lionizing Cecil, and sometimes, when with her,
the pain of the return was forgotten, and he so enjoyed her
admiration of his native city that he no longer felt the terrible
craving for his father’s presence. They went to Nestun, and
wandered about in the woods; they took Cecil to see the quaint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>old wooden church from Fortun; they had a merry picnic at
Fjessanger, and an early expedition to the Bergen fish market,
determined that Cecil should enjoy that picturesque scene with
the weather-beaten fishermen, the bargaining housewives with
their tin pails, the boats laden with their shining wealth of fishes.
Again and again, too, they walked up the beautiful <i><span lang="da" xml:lang="da">fjeldveien</span></i> to
gain that wonderful bird’s-eye view over the town and the harbor
and the lakes. But perhaps no one was sorry when the
visit came to an end, and they were once more on their travels,
going by sea to Molde and thence to Naes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quite late one evening that they steamed down the
darkening Romsdalsfjord. The great Romsdalshorn reared its
dark head solemnly into the calm sky, and everywhere peace
seemed to reign. The steamer was almost empty; Frithiof and
Cecil stood alone at the forecastle end, silently reveling in the
exquisite view before them.</p>

<p class='c000'>A thousand thoughts were seething in Frithiof’s mind; that
first glimpse of the Romsdalshorn had taken him back to the
great crisis of his life; in strange contrast to that peaceful
scene he had a vision of a crowded London street; in yet
stranger contrast to his present happiness and relief he once
more looked into the past, and thought of his hopeless misery,
of his deadly peril, of the struggle he had gone through, of the
chance which had made him pause before the picture shop,
and of his recognition of the painting of his native mountains.
Then he thought of his first approach to Rowan Tree House
on that dusky November afternoon, and he thought of his
strange dream of the beasts, and the precipice, and the steep
mountain-side, and the opening door with the Madonna and
Child framed in dazzling light. Just at that moment from
behind the dark purple mountains rose the great, golden-red
moon. It was a sight never to be forgotten, and the glow and
glamour cast by it over the whole scene was indescribable.
Veblungsnaes with its busy wooden pier and its dusky houses
with here and there a light twinkling from a window; the
Romsdalshorn with its lofty peak, and the beautiful valley beyond
bathed in that sort of dim brightness and misty radiance
which can be given by nothing but the rising moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof turned and looked at Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had taken off her hat that she might better enjoy the
soft evening breeze which was ruffling up her fair hair; her
blue dress was one of those shades which are called “new,”
but which are not unlike the old blue in which artists have always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>loved to paint the Madonna; her face was very quiet and
happy; the soft evening light seemed to etherealize her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will never know how much I owe to you,” he said impetuously.
“Had it not been for all that you did for me in
the past I could not possibly have been here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She had been looking toward Veblungsnaes, but now she
turned to him with a glance so beautiful, so rapturously happy,
that it seemed to waken new life within him. He was so
amazed at the strength of the passion which suddenly took possession
of him that for a time he could hardly believe he was
in real waking existence; this magical evening light, this exquisite
fjord with its well-known mountains, might well be the
scenery of some dream; and Cecil did not speak to him, she
merely gave him that one glance and smile, and then stood
beside him silently, as though there were no need of speech
between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was glad she was silent, for he dreaded lest anything
should rouse him and take him back to the dull, cold past—the
past in which for so long he had lived with his heart half
dead, upheld only by the intention of redeeming his father’s
honor. To go back to that state would be terrible; moreover,
the aim no longer existed. The debts were paid—his work
was over, and yet his life lay before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was it to be merely a business life—a long round of duty
work? or was it possible that love might glorify the every-day
round—that even for him this intense happiness, which as yet
he could hardly believe to be real, might actually dawn?</p>

<p class='c000'>And the steamer glided on over the calm moonlit waters,
and drew nearer to Veblungsnaes, where an eager-faced crowd
waited for the great event of the day. A sudden terror seized
Frithiof that some one would come to their end of the steamer
and break the spell that bound him, and then the very fear
itself made him realize that this was no dream, but a great reality.
Cecil was beside him, and he loved her—a new era had
begun in his life. He loved her, and grudged whatever could
interfere with that strange sense of nearness to her and of bliss
in the consciousness which had suddenly changed his whole
world.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no one came near them. Still they stood there—side
by side, and the steamer moved on peacefully once more, the
silvery track still marking the calm fjord till they reached the
little boat that was to land them at Naes. He wished that
they could have gone on for hours, for as yet the mere consciousness
of his own love satisfied him—he wanted nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>but the rapture of life after death—of brightness after gloom.
When it was no longer possible to prolong that strange, weird
calm, he went, like a man half awake, to see after the luggage,
and presently, with an odd, dazzled feeling found himself on
the shore, where Herr Lossius, the landlord, stood to welcome
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which is the hotel?” asked Roy.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Herr Lossius replied in his quaint, careful English, “It
is yonder, sir—that house just under the moon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you ever hear such a poetical direction?” said Cecil,
smiling as they walked up the road together.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It suits the evening very well,” said Frithiof. “I am glad
he did not say, ‘First turning to your right, second to your left,
and keep straight on,’ like a Londoner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the “house under the moon,” though comfortable
enough, did not prove a good sleeping-place. All the night
long Frithiof lay broad awake in his quaint room, and at length,
weary of staring at the picture of the stag painted on the window-blind,
he drew it up and lay looking out at the dark Romsdalshorn,
for the bed was placed across the window, and commanded a
beautiful view.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could think of nothing but Cecil, of the strange, new insight
that had come to him so suddenly, of the marvel that,
having known her so long and so intimately, he had only just
realized the beauty of her character, with its tender, womanly
grace, its quiet strength, its steadfastness, and repose. Then
came a wave of anxious doubt that drove sleep farther than
ever from him. It was no longer enough to be conscious of his
love for her. He began to wonder whether it was in the least
probable that she could ever care for him. Knowing the whole
of his past life, knowing his faults so well, was it likely that she
would ever dream of accepting his love?</p>

<p class='c000'>He fell into great despondency; but the recollection of that
sweet, bright glance which she had given him in reply to his
impetuous burst of gratitude, reassured him; and when, later
on, he met her at breakfast his doubts were held at bay, and
his hopes raised, not by anything that she did or said, but by
her mere presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether Sigrid at all guessed at the state of affairs and
arranged accordingly, or whether it was a mere chance, it
so happened that for the greater part of that day as they traveled
through the beautiful Romsdal, Frithiof and Cecil were
together.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will you do?” said Cecil to herself, “when all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>is over? How will you go back to ordinary life when the tour
is ended!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But though she tried in this way to take the edge off her
pleasure, she could not do it. Afterward might take care of
itself. There was no possibility of realizing it now, she would
enjoy to the full just the present that was hers, the long talks
with Frithiof, the delightful sense of fellowship with him, the
mutual enjoyment of that exquisite valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so they drove on, past Aak, with its lovely trees and its
rippling river, past the lovely Romsdalshorn, past the Troltinderne,
with their weird outline looming up against the blue sky
like the battlements and pinnacles of some magic city. About
the middle of the day they reached Horgheim, where it had
been arranged that they should spend the night. Frithiof was
in a mood to find everything beautiful; he even admired the
rather bare-looking posting-station, just a long, brown, wooden
house with a high flight of steps to the door and seats on either
side. On the doorstep lay a fine white and tabby cat, which
he declared he could remember years before when they had
visited the Romsdal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that is very possible,” said the landlady, with a
pleased look. “For we have had him these fourteen years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one crowded round to look at this antiquated cat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is his name?” asked Cecil, speaking in Norse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His name is Mons,” said the landlady, “Mons Horgheim.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They all laughed at the thought of a cat with a surname, and
then came a general dispersion in quest of rooms. Cecil and
Swanhild chose one which looked out across a grassy slope to
the river; the Rauma just at this part is very still, and of a
deep green color; beyond were jagged, gray mountains and the
moraine of a glacier covered here and there with birch and
juniper. Half-a-dozen little houses with grass-grown roofs
nestled at the foot, and near them were sweet-smelling hayfields
and patches of golden corn.</p>

<p class='c000'>They dined merrily on salmon, wild strawberries, and cream,
and then a walk was proposed. Cecil, however, excused herself,
saying that she had letters to write home, and so it chanced
that Frithiof and Sigrid had what did not often fall to their lot
in those days, the chance of a quiet talk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is wrong with you, dear old boy?” she said; for
since they had left Horgheim she could not but notice that he
had grown grave and absorbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing,” he said, with rather a forced laugh. But, though
he tried to resume his usual manner and talked with her and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>teased her playfully, she knew that he had something on his
mind, and half-hopefully, half-fearfully, made one more attempt
to win his confidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us rest here in the shade,” she said, settling herself
comfortably under a silver birch. “Roy and Swanhild walk at
such a pace that I think we will let them have the first view of
the Mongefos.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He threw himself down on the grass beside her, and for a
time there was silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You did not sleep last night,” she said presently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you know that?” he said, his color rising a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I know it by your forehead. You were worrying over
something. Come, confess.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sat up and began to speak abruptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to ask you a question,” he said, looking up the valley
beyond her and avoiding her eyes. “Do you think a man has
any business to offer to a woman a love which is not his first
passion?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“At one time I thought not,” said Sigrid. “But as I grew
older and understood things more it seemed to me different.
I think there would be few marriages in the world if we made
a rule of that sort. And a woman who really loved would lose
sight of all selfishness and littleness and jealousy just because
of the strength of her love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned and looked straight into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And if I were to tell Cecil that I loved her, do you think
she would at any rate listen to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not going to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to that question,” said
Sigrid, suddenly bending forward and giving him a kiss—a
salute almost unknown between a Norwegian brother and
sister. “But I will say instead ‘Go and try.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think then—”</p>

<p class='c000'>She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think at all,” she said laughingly. “Good-by. I am
going to meet the others at the Mongefos, and you—you are
going back to Horgheim. Adjö.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She waved her hand to him and walked resolutely away.
He watched her out of sight, then fell back again to his former
position on the grass, and thought. She had told him nothing
and yet somehow had brought to him a most wonderful sense
of rest and peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently he got up, and began to retrace his steps along the
valley.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>
  <h2 id='XL' class='c005'>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The afternoon was not so clear as the morning had been, yet
it had a beauty of its own which appealed to Frithiof very
strongly. The blue sky had changed to a soft pearly gray, all
round him rose grave, majestic mountains, their summits clear
against the pale background, but wreaths of white mist clinging
about their sides in fantastic twists and curves which bridged
over huge yawning chasms and seemed to join the valley into
a great amphitheater. The stern gray and purple rocks looked
hardly real, so softened were they by the luminous summer haze.
Here and there the white snow gleamed coldly in long deep
crevices, or in broad clefts where from year’s end to year’s end
it remained unmelted by sun or rain. On each side of the road
there was a wilderness of birch and fir and juniper bushes,
while in the far distance could be heard the Mongefos with its
ceaseless sound of many waters, repeated on either hand by the
smaller waterfalls. Other sound there was none save the faint
tinkle of cowbells or the rare song of the little black and white
wagtails, which seemed the only birds in the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly he perceived a little further along the road a slim
figure leaning against the fence, the folds of a blue dress, the
gleam of light-brown hair under a sealskin traveling cap. His
heart began to beat fast, he strode on more quickly, and Cecil,
hearing footsteps, looked up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had finished my letter and thought I would come out to
explore a little,” she said, as he joined her. “You have come
back?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he said, “I have come back to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She glanced at him questioningly, startled by his tone, but
before his eager look her eyelids dropped, and a soft glow of
color suffused her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cecil,” he said, “do you remember what you said years
ago about men who worked hard to make their fortune and
then retired and were miserable because they had nothing
to do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh yes,” she said, “I remember it very well, and have
often seen instances of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am like that now,” he continued. “My work seems over,
and I stand at the threshold of a new life. It was you who
saved me from ruin in my old life—will you be my helper
now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think I really could help?” she said wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>He looked at her gentle eyes, at her pure, womanly face, and
he knew that his life was in her hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not know,” he said gravely. “It depends on whether
you could love me—whether you will let me speak of my love
for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as he paused, partly because his English words would
not come very readily, partly in hope of some sign of encouragement
from her, she turned to him with a face which shone with
heavenly light.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There must never be any secrets between us,” she said,
speaking quite simply and directly. “I have loved you ever
since you first came to us—years ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was nothing to Frithiof that they were standing at the side
of the king’s highway—he had lost all sense of time and place—the
world only contained for him the woman who loved him—the
woman who let him clasp her in his strong arm—let him
press her sweet face to his.</p>

<p class='c000'>And still from the distance came the sound of many waters,
and the faint tinkle of the cowbells, and the song of the little
black and white birds. The grave gray mountains seemed like
strong and kindly friends who sheltered them and shut them in
from all intrusion of the outer world, but they were so entirely
absorbed in each other that they had not a thought of anything
else.</p>

<p class='c000'>“With you I shall have courage to begin life afresh,” he said,
after a time. “To have the right to love you—to be always
with you—that will be everything to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then as he thought of her true-hearted confession, he
tried to understand a little better the unseen ordering of his
life, and he loved to think that those weary years had been
wasted neither on him nor on Cecil herself. He could not for
one moment doubt that her pure, unselfish love had again and
again shielded him from evil, that all through his English life,
with its hard struggles and bitter sufferings, her love had in
some unknown way been his safeguard, and that his life,
crippled by the faithlessness of a woman, had by a woman also
been redeemed. All his old morbid craving for death had
gone; he eagerly desired a long life, that he might live with
her, work for her, shield her from care, fill up, to the best of
his power, what was incomplete in her life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall have a postscript to add to my letter,” said Cecil
presently, looking up at him with the radiant smile which he
so loved to see on her lips. “What a very feminine one it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>be! We say, you know, in England, that a woman’s postscript
is the most important part of her letter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will your father and mother ever spare you to me?” said
Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They will certainly welcome you as their son,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Mr. and Mrs. Horner?” suggested Frithiof mischievously.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at the thought of the consternation of her worthy cousins
Cecil could do nothing but laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind,” she said, “they have always disapproved of
me as much as they have of you; they will perhaps say that it
is, after all, a highly suitable arrangement!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder whether Swanhild will say the same?” said
Frithiof with a smile; “here she comes, hurrying home alone.
Will you wait by the river and let me just tell her my good
news?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He walked along the road to meet his sister, who, spite of
added years and inches, still retained much of her childlikeness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you all alone?” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, there is no fun,” said Swanhild. “When Roy and
Sigrid are out on a holiday they are just like lovers, so I came
back to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will you say when I tell you that I am betrothed,”
he said teasingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked up in his face with some alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are only making fun of me,” she protested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the contrary, I am stating the most serious of facts.
Come, I want your congratulations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But who are you betrothed to?” asked Swanhild, bewildered.
“Can it be to Madale? And, oh dear, what a horrid
time to choose for it—you will be just no good at all. I really
do think you might have waited till the end of the tour.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It might possibly have been managed if you had spoken
sooner,” said Frithiof, with mock gravity, “but you come too
late—the deed is done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I shall have Cecil to talk to, so after all it doesn’t
much matter,” said Swanhild graciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, unfortunately, she also has become betrothed,” said
Frithiof, watching the bewildered little face with keen pleasure,
and seeing the light of perception suddenly dawn on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swanhild caught his hand in hers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t mean—” she began.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh yes,” cried Frithiof, “but I do mean it very much indeed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Come,” and he hurried her down the grassy slope to
the river. “I shall tell Cecil every word you have been saying.”
Then, as she rose to meet them, he said with a laugh,
“This selfish child thinks we might have put it off till the end
of the tour for her special benefit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” cried Swanhild, flying toward Cecil with outstretched
arms. “I never knew it was to you he was betrothed—and
you could never be that horrid, moony kind who are
always sitting alone together in corners.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At which ingenuous congratulations they all laughed so immoderately
that Mons Horgheim the cat was roused from his
afternoon nap on the steps of the station, and after a preliminary
stretch strolled down toward the river to see what was the
matter, and to bring the sobriety and accumulated wisdom of
his fourteen years to bear upon the situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, well,” said Swanhild, with a comical gesture, “there is
clearly nothing for me but, as they say in Italy, to stay at home
and nurse the cat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And catching up the astonished Mons, she danced away,
eager to be the first to tell the good news to Roy and
Sigrid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be really very convenient,” she remarked, to the
infinite amusement of her elders. “We shall not lose Frithiof
at all; he will only have to move across to Rowan Tree
House.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And ultimately that was how matters arranged themselves,
so that the house which had sheltered Frithiof in his time of
trouble became his home in this time of his prosperity.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not rushed all at once into full light and complete
manhood and lasting happiness. Very slowly, very gradually,
the life that had been plunged in darkness had emerged into
faint twilight as he had struggled to redeem his father’s name;
then, by degrees, the brightness of dawn had increased, and,
sometimes helped, sometimes hindered by the lives which had
come into contact with his own, he had at length emerged into
clearer light, till, after long waiting, the sun had indeed risen.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Swanhild had prophesied, they were by no means selfish
lovers, and, far from spoiling the tour, their happiness did much
to add to its success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil hardly knew which part of it was most delightful to
her, the return of Molde and the pilgrimage to the quaint little
jeweler’s shop where they chose two plain gold betrothal rings
such as are always used in Norway; or the merry journey to
the Geiranger; or the quiet days at Oldören, in that lovely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>valley with the river curving and bending its way between
wooded banks, and the rampart of grand, craggy mountains
with snowy peaks, her own special mountain, as Frithiof called
Cecilienkrone, dominating all.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at Oldören that she saw for the first time one of the
prettiest sights in Norway—a country wedding. The charming
bride, Pernilla, in her silver-gilt crown and bridal ornaments,
had her heartiest sympathy, and Frithiof, happening to catch
sight of the fiddler standing idly by the churchyard gate when
the ceremony was over, brought him into the hotel and set every
one dancing. Anna Rasmusen, the clever and charming manager
of the inn, volunteered to try the <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">spring dans</span></i> with Halfstan,
the guide. The hamlet was searched for dancers of the <em>halling</em>,
and the women showed them the pretty <em>jelster</em> and the <em>tretur</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>By degrees all the population of the place crowded in as
spectators, and soon Johannes and Pernilla, the bride and bridegroom,
made their way through the throng, and, each carrying
a decanter, approached the visitors, shook hands with them,
and begged that they would drink their health. There was
something strangely simple and charming about the whole thing.
Such a scene could have been found in no other country save
in grand, free old Norway, where false standards of worth are
abolished, and where mutual respect and equal rights bind
each to each in true brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day after the wedding they spent at the Brixdals glacier,
rowing all together up the lake, but afterward separating, Frithiof
and Cecil walking in advance of the others up the beautiful
valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There will soon be a high-road to this glacier,” said Frithiof,
“but I am glad they are only beginning it now, and that we
have this rough path.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Cecil was glad too. She liked the scramble and the
little bit of climbing needed here and there; she loved to feel
the strength and protection of Frithiof’s hand as he led her
over the rocks and bowlders. At last, after a long walk, they
reached a smooth, grassy oasis, shaded by silver birches and
bordered by a river, beyond, the Brixdalsbrae gleamed white
through the trees, with here and there exquisite shades of blue
visible in the ice even at that distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is just like the Land of Beulah,” said Cecil, smiling,
“and the glacier is the celestial city. How wonderful those
broken pinnacles of ice are!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look at these two little streams running side by side for
so long and at last joining,” said Frithiof. “They are like our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>two lives. For so many years you have been to me as we should
say <i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">fortrölig</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What does that mean?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is untranslatable,” he said. “It is that in which one
puts one’s trust and confidence, but more besides. It means
exactly what you have always been to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil looked down at the little bunch of forget-me-nots and
lilies of the valley—the Norwegian national flowers with which
Frithiof loved to keep her supplied—and the remembrance of
all that she had borne during these five years came back to
her, and by contrast made the happy present yet sweeter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think,” she said, “I should like Signor Donati to know
of our happiness; he was the first who quite understood you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I must write to him,” said Frithiof. “There is no
man to whom I owe more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And thinking of the Italian’s life and character and of his
own past, he grew silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know,” he said at length, “there is one thing I want
you to do for me. I want you to give me back my regard for
the Sogne once more. I want, on our way home, just to pass
Balholm again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so one day it happened that they found themselves on
the well-remembered fjord, and coming up on deck when dinner
was over, saw that already the familiar scenes of the Frithiof
saga were coming into view.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look! look!” said Frithiof. “There, far in front of us is
the Kvinnafos, looking like a thread of white on the dark rock;
and over to the right is Framnaes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil stood beside him on the upper deck, and gradually the
scene unfolded. They saw the little wooded peninsula, the
lovely mountains round the Fjaerlands fjord, Munkeggen itself,
with much more snow than during their last visit, and then,
once again, King Bele’s grave, and the scattered cottages, with
their red-tiled roofs, and the familiar hotel, somewhat enlarged,
yet recalling a hundred memories.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gravely and thoughtfully Frithiof looked on the little hamlet
and on Munkeggen. It was a picture that had been traced on
his mind by pleasure and engraved by pain. Cecil drew a little
nearer to him, and though no word passed between them, yet
intuitively their thoughts turned to one who must ever be associated
with those bright days spent in the house of Ole Kvikne
long ago. There was no indignation in their thoughts of her,
but there was pain, and pity, and hope, and the love which is
at once the source and the outcome of forgiveness. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>wondered much how matters stood with her out in the far-off
southern seas, where she struggled on in a new life, which must
always, to the very end, be shadowed by the old. And then
Frithiof thought of his father, of his own youth, of the wonderful
glamor and gladness that had been doomed so soon to pass
into total eclipse, and feeling like some returned ghost, he
glided close by the flagstaff, and the gray rocks, and the trees
which had sheltered his farewell to Blanche. A strange and
altogether indescribable feeling stole over him, but it was
speedily dispelled. There was a link which happily bound his
past to his present—a memory which nothing could spoil—on
the quay he instantly perceived the well-remembered faces of
the kindly landlord, Ole Kvikne, and his brother Knut.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See!” she exclaimed with a smile, “there are the Kviknes
looking not a day older! We must see if they remember
us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Did they not remember? Of course they did! And what
bowing and hand-shaking went on in the brief waiting time.
They had heard of Frithiof, moreover, and knew how nobly he
had redeemed his father’s name. They were enchanted at
meeting him once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me have the pleasure, Kvikne, to introduce to you
my betrothed, who was also your guest long ago,” said
Frithiof, taking Cecil’s hand and placing it in that of the
landlord.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the warm congratulations and hearty good wishes
of Ole and Knut Kvikne were only cut short by the bell,
which warned the travelers that they must hasten up the
gangway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall come back,” said Frithiof. “Another summer we
shall stay with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Cecil. “After all there is nothing equal to
Balholm. I had forgotten how lovely it was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As they glided on they left the little place bathed in sunshine,
and in silence they watched it, till at last a bend in the
fjord hid it from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frithiof fell into deep thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>What part had that passionate first love of his played in his
life-story? Well, it had been to him a curse; it had dragged
him down into depths of despair and to the verge of vice; it
had steeped him in bitterness and filled his heart with anguish.
Yet a more perfect love had awaited him—a passion less fierce
but more tender, less vehement but more lasting; and all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>years Cecil’s heart had really been his, though he had so little
dreamed of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As if in a picture, he saw the stages through which he had
passed—the rapture of mere physical existence; the intolerable
pain and humiliation of Blanche’s betrayal; the anguish
of bereavement; the shame of bankruptcy; the long effort to
pay the debts; the slow return to belief in human beings; the
toilsome steps that had each brought him a clearer knowledge
of the Unseen, for which he had once felt no need; and,
finally, this wonderful love springing up like a fountain in his
life, ready to gladden his somewhat prosaic round of daily
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evening when they left the steamer at Sogndal, but
they were none of them in a mood for settling down, and indeed
the weather was so hot that they often preferred traveling
after supper. So it was arranged that they should go on
to a very primitive little place called Hillestad, sleep there for
a few hours, and then proceed to the Lyster fjord. Cecil, who
was a much better walker than either Sigrid or Swanhild,
was to go on foot with Frithiof; the others secured a stolkjaerre
and a carriole, and went on in advance with the
luggage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two lovers walked briskly along the side of the fjord,
but slackened their pace when they reached the long, sandy
hill, with its sharp zigzags; the evening was still and cloudless;
above them towered huge, rocky cliffs, partly veiled by
undergrowth, and all the air was sweet with the scent of the
pine trees. They were close to St. Olaf’s well, where, from
time immemorial, the country people have come to drink and
pray for recovery from illness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you think we ought to drink to my future health,”
said Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled, yet in his eyes she saw all the time the look of
sadness that had come to him as they approached Balholm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one sting in his perfect happiness was the thought that
he could not bring to Cecil the unbroken health that had once
been his. He knew that the strain of his passed trouble had
left upon him marks which he must carry to his grave, and
that the consequences of Blanche’s faithlessness had brought
with them a secret anxiety which must to some extent shadow
Cecil’s life. The knowledge was hard: it humiliated him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil knew him so well that she read his thoughts in an
instant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>“Look at all these little crosses set up in the moss on this
rock!” she exclaimed when they had scrambled up the steep
ascent. “I wonder how many hundreds of years this has been
the custom? I wonder how many troubled people have come
here to drink?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And have gained nothing by their superstition?” said
Frithiof.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was superstition,” she said thoughtfully. “And yet, perhaps,
the sight of the cross and the drinking of the water at
least helped them to new thoughts of suffering and of life.
Who knows, perhaps some of them went away able to glory in
their infirmities?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not speak for some minutes, but stood lost in the train
of thought suggested to him by her words. The sadness gradually
died out of his face, and she quite understood that it was
with no trace of superstition, but merely as a sign of gratitude
for a thought which had helped him, that he took two little
straight twigs, stooped to drink from St. Olafskilde, and then
set up his cross among the others in the mossy wall. After
that they clambered down over the bowlders into the sandy
road once more, and climbed the steep hill leisurely, planning
many things for the future—the rooms in Rowan Tree House,
the little wooden cottage that they meant to build at Gödesund,
three hours by water from Bergen, on a tiny island, which
might be bought at a trifling cost; the bright holiday weeks
that they would spend there; the work they might share; the
efforts they might make together in their London life.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the sharp contrast between this pictured future and the
actual past could hardly fail to strike one of Frithiof’s temperament;
it was the thought of this which prompted him to speak
as they paused to rest on the wooded heights above Hillestad.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I almost wonder,” he said, “that you have courage to marry
such an ill-starred fellow as I have always proved to be. You
are very brave to take the risk.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She answered him only with her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So,” he said with a smile, “you think, perhaps, after all the
troubles there must be a good time coming?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That may very well be,” she replied, “but now that we
belong to each other outer things matter little.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you remember the lines about Norway in the Princess?”
he said. “Your love has made them true for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say them now,” she said; “I have forgotten,”</p>

<p class='c000'>And, looking out over the ruddy sky where, in this night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>hour, the glow of sunset mingled with the glow of dawn, he
quoted the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“I was one</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom the touch of all mischance but came</div>
      <div class='line'>As night to him that sitting on a hill</div>
      <div class='line'>Sees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun</div>
      <div class='line'>Set into sunrise.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>She followed the direction of his gaze and looked, through the
fir-trees on the hill upon which they were resting, down to the
lovely lake which lay below them like a sheet of mother-of-pearl
in the tranquil light. She looked beyond to the grand
cliff-like mountains with their snowy tops touched here and
there into the most exquisite rose-color by the rising sun; and
then she turned back to the strong Norse face with its clearly
cut features, its look of strength, and independence, and noble
courage, and her heart throbbed with joy as she thought how
foreign to it was that hard, bitter expression of the past. As
he repeated the words “Set into sunrise” his eyes met hers
fully; all the tenderness and strength of his nature and an
infinite promise of future possibilities seemed to strike down
into her very soul in that glance. He drew her toward him,
and over both of them there stole the strange calm which is
sometimes the outcome of strong feeling.</p>

<p class='c000'>All nature seemed full of perfect peace; and with the sight
of those snowy mountains and the familiar scent of the pines
to tell him that he was indeed in his own country, with Cecil’s
loving presence to assure him of his new possession, and with
a peace in his heart which had first come to him in bitter
humiliation and trouble, Frithiof, too, was at rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, what were the possible trials that lay before them?
What was all earthly pain? Looked at in a true light, suffering
seemed, indeed, but as this brief northern night, and death but
as the herald of eternal day.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>“Cecil,” said Frithiof, looking again into her sweet, grave
eyes, “who would have thought that the <em>Linnæa</em> gathered all
those years ago should prove the first link in the chain that
was to bind us together forever?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was strange,” she replied, with a smile, as she gathered
one of the long trails growing close by and looked at the lovely
little white bells with their pink veins.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took it from her, and began to twine it in her hair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>“I didn’t expect to find it here,” he said, “and brought a
fine plant of it from Nord fjord. We must take it home with
us that you may have some for your bridal wreath.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She made a little exclamation of doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, Frithiof? How long do you think it will go on
flowering?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For another month,” he said, taking her glowing face
between his hands and stooping to kiss her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only a month!” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surely that will be long enough to read the banns?” he
said, with a smile. “And you really ought not to keep the
<em>Linnæa</em> waiting a day longer.”</p>

  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
